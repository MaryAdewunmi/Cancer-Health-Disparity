"To operationalize an intersectionality framework using a novel statistical approach and with these efforts, improve the estimation of disparities in access (i.e., wait time to treatment entry) to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment beyond race.','Sample of 941,286 treatment episodes collected in 2015-2017 in the United States from the Treatment Episodes Data Survey (TEDS-A) and a subset from California (n = 188,637) and Maryland (n = 184,276), states with the largest sample of episodes.','This retrospective subgroup analysis used a two-step approach called virtual twins. In Step 1, we trained a classification model that gives the probability of waiting (1 day or more). In Step 2, we identified subgroups with a higher probability of differences due to race. We tested three classification models for Step 1 and identified the model with the best estimation.','Client data were collected by states during personal interviews at admission and discharge.','Random forest was the most accurate model for the first step of subgroup analysis. We found large variation across states in racial disparities. Stratified analysis of two states with the largest samples showed critical factors that augmented disparities beyond race. In California, factors such as service setting, referral source, and homelessness defined the subgroup most vulnerable to racial disparities. In Maryland, service setting, prior episodes, receipt of medication-assisted opioid treatment, and primary drug use frequency augmented disparities beyond race. The identified subgroups had significantly larger racial disparities.','The methodology used in this study enabled a nuanced understanding of the complexities in disparities research. We found state and service factors that intersected with race and augmented disparities in wait time. Findings can help decision makers target modifiable factors that make subgroups vulnerable to waiting longer to enter treatment."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare and health outcomes are longstanding. The real-time emergence of COVID-19 disparities has heightened the public and scientific discourse about structural inequities contributing to the greater risk of morbidity and mortality among racial and ethnic minority populations and other underserved groups. A key aspect of assuring health equity is addressing social determinants that lead to adverse health outcomes among minoritized groups. This article presents an exploratory social determinants of health (SDOH) conceptual framework for understanding racial and ethnic COVID-19 disparities, including factors related to health and healthcare, socioeconomics, and environmental determinants. The model also illustrates the backdrop of structural racism and discrimination, which directly affect health and COVID-19 exposure risk, and thus transmission, infection, and death. We also describe a special SDOH collection in the PhenX Toolkit (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures), which includes established measures to promote standardization of assessment and the use of common data elements in research contexts. The use of common constructs, measures, and data elements are important for data integration, understanding the causes of health disparities, and evaluating interventions to reduce them. Substandard SDOH are among the primary drivers of health disparities-and scientific approaches to address these key concerns require identification and leveled alignment with the root causes. The overarching goal of this discussion is to broaden the consideration of mechanisms by which populations with health disparities face additional SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks, and to encourage research to develop interventions to reduce SDOH-associated disparities in COVID-19 and other conditions and behaviors."
"Racial disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have been well-documented. However, there may also be racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates which, if present, would further exacerbate the existing disparities. No previously published articles have identified and quantified potential racial disparities in vaccination throughout the USA at any geography lower than the national level.','Using data compiled from state health departments, we calculated racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination for the Black and Hispanic populations compared to the White population in each state. We explored the relationship between a state-level index of structural racism and the observed differences in the racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination across states for both the Black and Hispanic populations by conducting linear regression analyses.','Racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination were present for both the Black and Hispanic populations in the overwhelming majority of states. There were vast differences between the states in the magnitude of the racial disparity in race-specific vaccination rates. These differences were largely explained by differences in the level of structural racism in each state. The relationship between structural racism and the racial disparities in vaccination was not entirely explained by racial differences in vaccine hesitancy or political affiliation.','There are marked racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccination throughout the USA, and structural racism is strongly associated with the magnitude of these disparities. Efforts to reduce these disparities must address not only individual behavior but must also confront the structural barriers that are inhibiting equitable vaccine distribution."
"Racial disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes are well-documented in the US, with Black people having higher incidence rates and worse outcomes than White people. In this review, we present a summary of almost 30 years of research conducted by investigators at the Karmanos Cancer Institute's (KCI's) Population Studies and Disparities Research (PSDR) Program focusing on Black-White disparities in cancer incidence, care, and outcomes. The studies in the review focus on individuals diagnosed with cancer from the Detroit Metropolitan area, but also includes individuals included in national databases. Using an organizational framework of three generations of studies on racial disparities, this review describes racial disparities by primary cancer site, disparities associated with the presence or absence of comorbid medical conditions, disparities in treatment, and disparities in physician-patient communication, all of which contribute to poorer outcomes for Black cancer patients. While socio-demographic and clinical differences account for some of the noted disparities, further work is needed to unravel the influence of systemic effects of racism against Black people, which is argued to be the major contributor to disparate outcomes between Black and White patients with cancer. This review highlights evidence-based strategies that have the potential to help mitigate disparities, improve care for vulnerable populations, and build an equitable healthcare system. Lessons learned can also inform a more equitable response to other health conditions and crises."
"The persistent challenges of disparities in healthcare have led to significantly distinct outcomes among patients from different racial, ethnic, and underserved populations. Esophageal Cancer, not unlike other surgical diseases, has seen significant disparities in care. Esophageal cancer is currently the 6th leading cause of death from cancer and the 8th most common cancer in the world. Surgical disparities in the care of patients with Esophageal Cancer have been described in the literature, with a prevailing theme associating minority status with worse outcomes. The goal of this review is to provide an updated account of the literature on disparities in Esophageal Cancer presentation and treatment. We will approach this task through a conceptual framework that highlights the five main themes of surgical disparities: patient-level factors, provider-level factors, system and access issues, clinical care and quality, and postoperative outcomes, care and rehabilitation. All five categories play a complex role in the delivery of high-quality, equitable care for patients with Esophageal Cancer. While describing disparities in care is the first step to correcting them, moving forward, we should focus on developing effective interventions to mitigate disparities, policies linking disparities to quality-of-care metrics, and delivery system change to enable minority patients to more easily access high volume centers."
"Nutrition health disparities include differences in incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of diet-related diseases and conditions. Often, race, ethnicity, and the social determinants of health are associated with dietary intake and related health disparities. This report describes the nutrition health disparities research supported by NIH over the past decade and offers future research opportunities relevant to NIH's mission as described in the Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research.','Data were extracted from an internal reporting system from FY2010 to FY2019 using the Research, Condition, and Disease Categorization spending categories for Nutrition and Health Disparities.','Over the past decade, NIH-supported nutrition and health disparities research increased, from 860 grants in 2010 to 937 grants in FY2019, whereas total nutrition and health disparities funding remained relatively stable. The top 5 Institutes/Centers that funded nutrition and health disparities research (on the basis of both grant numbers and dollars) were identified. Principal areas of focus included several chronic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease) and research disciplines (e.g., clinical research and behavioral and social science). Focus areas related to special populations included pediatrics, minority health, aging, and women's health.','The gaps and trends identified in this analysis highlight the need for future nutrition and health disparities research, including a focus on American Indian and Asian populations and the growing topics of rural health, maternal health, and food insecurity. In alignment with the Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research, health equity may be advanced through innovative research approaches to develop effective targeted interventions to address these disparities."
"The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the existing literature on racial disparities in quality of palliative and end-of-life care and to demonstrate gaps in the exploration of underlying mechanisms that produce these disparities.','Countless studies over several decades have revealed that our healthcare system in the United States consistently produces poorer quality end-of-life for Black compared with White patients. Effective interventions to reduce these disparities are sparse and hindered by a limited understanding of the root causes of these disparities.','We searched PubMed, CINAHL and PsychInfo for research manuscripts that tested hypotheses about causal mechanisms for disparities in end-of-life care for Black patients. These studies were categorized by domains outlined in the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) framework, which are biological, behavioral, physical/built environment, sociocultural and health care systems domains. Within these domains, studies were further categorized as focusing on the individual, interpersonal, community or societal level of influence.','The majority of the studies focused on the Healthcare System and Sociocultural domains. Within the Health Care System domain, studies were evenly distributed among the individual, interpersonal, and community level of influence, but less attention was paid to the societal level of influence. In the Sociocultural domain, most studies focused on the individual level of influence. Those focusing on the individual level of influence tended to be of poorer quality.','The sociocultural environment, physical/built environment, behavioral and biological domains remain understudied areas of potential causal mechanisms for racial disparities in end-of-life care. In the Healthcare System domain, social influences including healthcare policy and law are understudied. In the sociocultural domain, the majority of the studies still focused on the individual level of influence, missing key areas of research in interpersonal discrimination and local and societal structural discrimination. Studies that focus on individual factors should be better screened to ensure that they are of high quality and avoid stigmatizing Black communities."
"Health care disparities are defined as health differences between groups that are avoidable, unnecessary, and unjust. Racial disparities in colorectal cancer mortality, particularly for Black patients, are well-described. Disparities in preventative measures, early detection, effective treatment, and posttreatment services contribute to these differences. Underlying these issues are patient, provider, health care system, and policy-level factors that lead to these disparities. Multilevel interventions designed to address each level of care can provide an effective means to mitigate these disparities."
"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers represent a diverse group of diseases. We assessed differences in geographic and racial disparities in cancer-specific mortality across subtypes, overall and by patient characteristics, in a geographically and racially diverse US population.','Clinical, sociodemographic, and treatment characteristics for patients diagnosed during 2009-2014 with colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or gastric cancer in Georgia were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database. Patients were classified by geography (rural or urban county) and race and followed for cancer-specific death. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate stratified hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between geography or race and cancer-specific mortality.','Overall, 77% of the study population resided in urban counties and 33% were non-Hispanic Black (NHB). For all subtypes, NHB patients were more likely to reside in urban counties than non-Hispanic White patients. Residing in a rural county was associated with an overall increased hazard of cancer-specific mortality for HCC (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.31), pancreatic (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03-1.19), and gastric cancer (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.03-1.32) but near-null for CRC. Overall racial disparities were observed for CRC (HR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.11-1.25) and HCC (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24). Geographic disparities were most pronounced among HCC patients receiving surgery. Racial disparities were pronounced among CRC patients receiving any treatment.','Geographic disparities were observed for the rarer GI cancer subtypes, and racial disparities were pronounced for CRC. Treatment factors appear to largely drive both disparities."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric anesthesia health services could result in minority children being at increased risk of poor outcomes, such as pain, anxiety, or over-exposure to medications. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the literature on such disparities does not exist to date. The objective of this study is to describe health services disparities in pediatric anesthetic care in the pre-, intra-, or post-operative period by synthesizing current literature. We searched the National Library of Medicine's PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 2007, and May 9, 2020, to identify literature on racial and ethnic health services disparities in pediatric anesthesia. We used the Institute of Medicine's definition of disparities. Health services were related to pre-, intra-, or post-operative anesthetic care of pediatric patients (< 18 years old). Out of 2110 studies, 10 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Nine out of the ten articles were single-institutional observational studies, based at tertiary hospitals. Sample sizes ranged from 74 to 37,618 discrete participants, for a total of 69,350 subjects across all studies. Results of these studies present low-quality evidence and heterogeneous conclusions regarding pediatric anesthesia health services disparities. This review demonstrates the paucity and diversity of research on racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric anesthesia health services and suggests how future work might utilize improved data and rigorous study designs."
"Health disparities disproportionately affect patients in racial and ethnic minority groups, and these disparities are linked to economic, environmental, and social disadvantage. It is widely known that health disparities impact patients with allergic and immunologic conditions, yet universal and comprehensive training in health disparities is lacking. More robust educational opportunities are needed to fully equip trainees with tools to recognize and develop effective strategies to reduce the burden of health disparities. Also, there are no universal standards or requirements for professional medical boards in their respective maintenance of certification programs that will ensure ongoing training for practicing providers that will help them identify and manage individual or societal issues such as social determinants that contribute to health disparities. Further, the long-term impact of systematic discrimination, implicit and overt bias, and medical mistrust among populations most often affected by disparities compounds the complexity of the methods and types of training that is desperately needed to overcome health disparities. We provide a commentary on important topics that should be addressed during allergy and immunology training and beyond. We further highlight strategies and tools that should be used to tackle this important issue affecting millions of patients under our specialty care. It is past time for us to go beyond the bedside and comprehensively integrate health disparities training in our fellowship programs and in our practices."
"Wide disparities in health status exist in the United States across race and ethnicity, broadly driven by social determinants of health-most notably race and ethnic group differences in income, education, and occupational status. However, disparities in disease frequency or severity remain underappreciated for many individual diseases whose distribution in the population varies. Such information is not readily accessible, nor emphasized in treatment guidelines or reviews used by practitioners. Specifically, a summary on disease-specific evidence of disparities from population-based studies is lacking. Our goal was to summarize the published evidence for specific disease disparities in the United States so that this knowledge becomes more widely available ""at the bedside"". We hope this summary stimulates health equity research at the disease level so that these disparities can be addressed effectively.','A targeted literature review of disorders in Pfizer's current pipeline was conducted. The 38 diseases included metabolic disorders, cancers, inflammatory conditions, dermatologic disorders, rare diseases, and infectious targets of vaccines under development. Online searches in Ovid and Google were performed to identify sources focused on differences in disease rates and severity between non-Hispanic Whites and Black/African Americans, and between non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics. As a model for how this might be accomplished for all disorders, disparities in disease rates and disease severity were scored to make the results of our review most readily accessible. After primary review of each condition by one author, another undertook an independent review. Differences between reviewers were resolved through discussion.','For Black/African Americans, 29 of the 38 disorders revealed a robust excess in incidence, prevalence, or severity. After sickle cell anemia, the largest excesses in frequency were identified for multiple myeloma and hidradenitis suppurativa. For Hispanics, there was evidence of disparity in 19 diseases. Most notable were metabolic disorders, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).','This review summarized recent disease-specific evidence of disparities based on race and ethnicity across multiple diseases, to inform clinicians and health equity research. Our findings may be well known to researchers and specialists in their respective fields but may not be common knowledge to health care providers or public health and policy institutions. Our hope is that this effort spurs research into the causes of the many disease disparities that exist in the United States."
"U.S. media has extensively covered racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths, which may ironically reduce public concern about COVID-19. In two preregistered studies (conducted in the fall of 2020), we examined whether perceptions of COVID-19 racial disparities predict White U.S. residents' attitudes toward COVID-19. Utilizing a correlational design (N = 498), we found that those who perceived COVID-19 racial disparities to be greater reported reduced fear of COVID-19, which predicted reduced support for COVID-19 safety precautions. In Study 2, we manipulated exposure to information about COVID-19 racial disparities (N = 1,505). Reading about the persistent inequalities that produced COVID-19 racial disparities reduced fear of COVID-19, empathy for those vulnerable to COVID-19, and support for safety precautions. These findings suggest that publicizing racial health disparities has the potential to create a vicious cycle wherein raising awareness reduces support for the very policies that could protect public health and reduce disparities."
"To provide a contemporary resource for clinicians and researchers on health equity research and implementation strategies to mitigate or eliminate disparities in health care.','Published studies and literature on health disparities, applicable research methodologies, and social determinants of health in otolaryngology.','Literature through October 2021 was reviewed, including consensus statements, guidelines, and scientific publications related to health care equity research. This research focus provides insights into existing disparities, why they occur, and the outcomes of interventions designed to resolve them. Progress toward equity requires intentionality in implementing quality improvement initiatives, tracking data, and fostering culturally competent care. Priority areas include improving access, removing barriers to care, and ensuring appropriate and effective treatment. Although research into health care disparities has advanced significantly in recent years, persistent knowledge gaps remain. Applying the lens of equity to data science can promote evidence-based practices and optimal strategies to reduce health inequities.','Health disparities research has a critical role in advancing equity in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. The phases of disparities research include detection, understanding, and reduction of disparities. A multilevel approach is necessary for understanding disparities, and health equity extensions can improve the rigor of evidence-based data synthesis. Finally, applying an equity lens is essential when designing and evaluating health care interventions, to minimize bias.','Understanding the data and practices related to disparities research may help promote an evidence-based approach to care of individual patients and populations, with the potential to eventually surmount the negative effects of health care disparities."
"A recently developed obstetrical comorbidity scoring system enables the comparison of severe maternal morbidity rates independent of health status at the time of birth hospitalization. However, the scoring system has not been evaluated in racial-ethnic and socioeconomic groups or used to assess disparities in severe maternal morbidity.','This study aimed to evaluate the performance of an obstetrical comorbidity scoring system when applied across racial-ethnic and socioeconomic groups and to determine the effect of comorbidity score risk adjustment on disparities in severe maternal morbidity.','We analyzed a population-based cohort of live births that occurred in California during 2011 through 2017 with linked birth certificates and birth hospitalization discharge data (n=3,308,554). We updated a previously developed comorbidity scoring system to include the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, Clinical Modifications diagnosis codes and applied the scoring system to subpopulations (groups) defined by race-ethnicity, nativity, payment method, and educational attainment. We then calculated the risk-adjusted rates of severe maternal morbidity (including and excluding blood transfusion-only cases) for each group and estimated the disparities for these outcomes before and after adjustment for the comorbidity score using logistic regression.','The obstetric comorbidity scores performed consistently across groups (C-statistics ranged from 0.68 to 0.76; calibration curves demonstrated overall excellent prediction of absolute risk). All non-White groups had significantly elevated rates of severe maternal morbidity before and after risk adjustment for comorbidities when compared with the White group (1.3% before, 1.3% after) (American Indian-Alaska Native: 2.1% before, 1.8% after; Asian: 1.5% before, 1.7% after; Black: 2.5% before, 2.0% after; Latinx: 1.6% before, 1.7% after; Pacific Islander: 2.2% before, 1.9% after; and multi-race groups: 1.7% before, 1.6% after). Risk adjustment also modestly increased disparities for the foreign-born group and government insurance groups. Higher educational attainment was associated with decreased severe maternal morbidity rates, which was largely unaffected by comorbidity risk adjustment. The pattern of results was the same whether or not transfusion-only cases were included as severe maternal morbidity.','These results support the use of an updated comorbidity scoring system to assess disparities in severe maternal morbidity. Disparities in severe maternal morbidity decreased in magnitude for some racial-ethnic and socioeconomic groups and increased in magnitude for other groups after adjustment for the comorbidity score."
"The associations between parental parenting styles and adolescents' development and health problems were also identified in a series of studies. However, the interactive impact of mother's and father's parenting style was less reported, which was implied in previous studies. In this study, we aim to analyze the associations between parental parenting style disparities and mental health among medical college students.','A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical college students in Shandong province, China, and 2,598 medical college students with parents were analyzed in this study. Items in a short form of Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran (EMBU) were used to calculate the parental parenting style disparities. Mental health was evaluated by the Kessler 10 scale.','The results of linear regressions showed that parental nurture reject disparities (RDs, β = 0.50, <i>p</i> < 0.001), parental emotional warmth disparities (WDs, β = 0.33, <i>p</i> < 0.001), parental overprotective disparities (ODs, β = 0.25, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and total disparities in parenting styles (TDs, β = 0.15, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were associated with mental health among medical college students, respectively. The other associated factors were age, ethnicity, chronic disease, above average family economic status, and good parental relationship.','Our findings supported the positive association between parental parenting style disparities and mental health problems. Further studies can test the mechanism and intervention of the findings about the importance of parental parenting style consistence on mental health."
"Prior malignancy exclusion criteria (PMEC) are often utilized in cancer clinical trials; however, the incidence of PMEC and the association of PMEC with trial participant age disparities remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify age disparities in oncologic randomized clinical trials as a result of PMEC. Using a comprehensive collection of modern phase III cancer clinical trials obtained via ClinicalTrials.gov, we assessed the incidence and covariates associated with trials excluding patients with prior cancers within 5+ years from registration (PMEC-5). Using the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we further sought to determine the correlation between PMEC-5 and age disparities. PMEC-5 were used in 41% of all trials, with higher PMEC-5 utilization among industry-supported trials as well as trials evaluating a targeted therapy. Comparing trial patient median ages with population-matched median ages by disease site and time-period, we assessed the association between PMEC-5 and age disparities among trial participants. PMEC-5 were independently associated with heightened age disparities, which further worsened with longer exclusionary timeframes. Together, PMEC likely contribute to age disparities, suggesting that eligibility criteria modernization through narrower PMEC timeframes may work toward reducing such disparities in cancer clinical trial enrollment."
"(1) Describe the existing head and neck cancer health disparities literature. (2) Contextualize these studies by using the NIMHD research framework (National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities). (3) Explore innovative ideas for further study and intervention.','Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.','Databases were systematically searched from inception to April 20, 2020. The PRISMA checklist was followed (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Two authors reviewed all articles for inclusion. Extracted data included health disparity population and outcomes, study details, and main findings and recommendations. Articles were also classified per the NIMHD research framework.','There were 148 articles included for final review. The majority (n = 104) focused on health disparities related to at least race/ethnicity. Greater than two-thirds of studies (n = 105) identified health disparities specific to health behaviors or clinical outcomes. Interaction between the <i>individual</i> domain of influence and the <i>health system</i> level of influence was most discussed (n = 99, 66.9%). Less than half of studies (n = 61) offered specific recommendations or interventions.','There has been extensive study of health disparities for head and neck cancer, largely focusing on individual patient factors or health care access and quality. This review identifies gaps in this research, with large numbers of retrospective database studies and little discussion of potential contributors and explanations for these disparities. We recommend shifting research on disparities upstream toward a focus on community and societal factors, rather than individual, and an evaluation of interventions to promote health equity."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a complex disease that disproportionately impacts Black men in the USA. The structural factors that drive heterogeneous outcomes for patients of differing backgrounds are probably the same ones that result in population-level disparities. The relative contribution of drivers along the PCa disease continuum is an active area of investigation and debate.','To critically synthesize the available evidence on PCa disparities from a population-level perspective in comparison to data from ""equal access and equal care settings"" and to provide a consensus summary of the state of PCa disparities.','A plenary panel on PCa disparities presented at the Prostate Cancer Foundation meeting on October 24, 2019 and ensuing discussions are reported here. We used a systematic literature review approach and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses to select the most relevant publications. A total of 3333 publications between 2011 and 2021 were retrieved, of which 52 were included in the review; an additional 13 articles on screening guidelines, seminal clinical trials, and statistical methodology were used in the evidence synthesis.','Race disparities in PCa are a result of a complex interaction between socioeconomic factors impacting access to care and ancestral/genetic factors that may influence tumor biology. Black men in the USA continue to have a nearly 1.8 times higher population-level incidence rate than White men. Failure to account for the race-specific incidence burden would continue to lead to residual disparity even after achieving relatively similar outcomes after primary treatment, resulting in a higher long-term mortality burden. Selection bias remains possible in PCa studies, which often rely on highly specific cohorts of Black men with higher use of health care resources that may not represent the average Black patient in the USA. Novel methods including mediation analysis and genetic ancestry rather than self-identified race can optimize analytical models investigating racial disparities and may lead to a better understanding of PCa genomic diversity and behavior.','Our findings emphasize the importance of racially diverse studies, including precision -omics, prevention, and targeted therapy initiatives, to elucidate mechanisms underlying racial differences in outcomes and response to therapy. We propose novel approaches for studying and addressing PCa disparities. Contemporary methods, particularly in the domain of mediation analysis, can promote scientific rigor in understanding these disparities.','Inaccurate data interpretation or lack of data altogether for Black men can impact policy and ultimately affect millions of individuals of African origin worldwide. Our review identifies a need to develop and prioritize a strategy for including Black and other men with prostate cancer in intervention studies and randomized clinical trials to halt the widening prostate cancer disparities."
"While survival of pediatric cancer has improved greatly over the past 40 years, demographic and socioeconomic disparities have meant that some groups have not benefitted as much from these advances. We conducted a rapid review to summarize literature on demographic and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes of childhood cancer, starting in 2000. We find that unequal outcomes have been noted for many of these groups across hematologic malignancies, central nervous system tumors, and other solid tumors, although occasional studies have noted absence of disparities for particular at-risk groups and diseases, and gaps in understanding of disparities for some cancer subtypes and groups still exist. These include disparities in duration of overall survival, risk of death, more extensive disease at presentation, and differences/delays in treatment. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of private insurance, and adolescent/young adult age are most often associated with these poorer outcomes. We then delve into documented and theorized causes of these disparities, including impaired access to care and clinical trials, differences in cancer biology, treatment non-adherence, language barriers, and implicit racial bias. Here, it is clear that socioeconomic factors account for a large proportion of disparities seen, although not all, and that the causes of disparities are complex and interconnected and still need to be better understood. Finally, in an effort to shift emphasis to addressing disparities, we review interventions against disparities that have been studied in childhood cancer patients and other populations, including improving clinical trial representation, communication, health literacy, and family navigation. We suggest ways forward in disparity mitigation toward a goal of achieving equitable cancer outcomes for all children."
"Given the persistence of racial health disparities, scholars have called for investigations into structural origins of health inequity and deeper engagement with theory. We systematically assessed uses of theory-including theory informed conceptualizations of race and ethnicity, social structure, and racial hierarchy-in epidemiology and other quantitative population health literature on racial health disparities.','We conducted a scoping review of systematically identified original research articles (n=650) that sought to explain racial health disparities; articles were published in 17 high-impact epidemiology, public health, and social science journals. Trained coders abstracted data from each article. We applied Public Health Critical Race Praxis and an iterative data-charting method to identify key themes.','Only 63 (9.7%) of 650 racial health disparities articles explicitly used theory. Among studies that engaged theory, one third (n=21/63) clearly conceptualized race and/or ethnicity, and a minority theorized social structure (n=19/63; 30%) and/or racial hierarchy as a structural relation (n=4/63; 6%).','There is a pressing need for racial health disparities researchers to unambiguously use theory to conceptualize race and ethnicity in social and historical contexts and explain relational aspects of racial hierarchy. These approaches can better elucidate and inform action on structural determinants of both racial inequity and racial health inequity."
"This scoping review aims to map out existing disparities research within the subspecialty of laryngology in order to highlight gaps in knowledge and guide future research.','Scoping Review.','We completed a scoping review of PubMed, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library for primary research focused on evaluating the existence and impact of disparities in race/ethnicity, sex/gender, insurance status, education level, income, geography, and LGBTQ identity in the context of various laryngological conditions. Publications of any design and date, performed in the United States, and focusing on the adult population exclusively were included.','Of the 4,999 unique abstracts identified, 51 articles were ultimately included. The most frequently examined condition in relation to disparities was laryngeal cancer (27 of 51), followed by voice disorders (15 of 51), deglutitive disorders (eight of 51), and airway disorders (one of 51). Sources of inequity evaluated from most common to least common were race/ethnicity (43 of 51), sex/gender (39 of 51), insurance status (23 of 51), geography (23 of 51), income (21 of 51), and education level (16 of 51). No study examined the association of LGBTQ identity with inequity.','This scoping review highlights the limited extent of disparities research in laryngology and establishes the need for further scholarship on the impact of disparities in laryngology care. The pathologies studied were, in decreasing order of frequency: laryngeal cancer, voice disorders, deglutitive disorders, and airway disorders. Race/ethnicity and sex/gender were the most common disparities examined, with no evaluation of LGBTQ-related care inequity.','NA Laryngoscope, 132:375-390, 2022."
"With the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the issue of increasing health disparities has received a great deal of attention from scholars and organizations. This study analyzes 2282 papers on COVID-19-related health disparities that have been retrieved from the WOS database, with 58,413 references. Using bibliometric analysis and knowledge mapping visualizations, the paper focuses on the academic structure and research trends by examining the research distribution of countries, journals and authors, keywords, highly cited articles, and reference co-citation. The results show that the United States has contributed the most, and the <i>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</i> has published the largest number of papers on this topic. As for the core authors, Michael Marmot is the most productive. Issues such as racial health, mental health, and digital health disparities have been the trending topics of the COVID-19-related health disparities. The research directions include the features, factors, and interventions of health disparities under the influence of COVID-19. As such, this study provides literature support and suggestions to investigate COVID-19-related health disparities. The findings of the paper also remind public health regulators to consider factors of health disparities when developing long-term public health regulatory policies related to the pandemic."
"Health care disparities exist in all medical specialties, including radiology. Raising awareness of established health care disparities is a critical component of radiology's efforts to mitigate disparities. Our primary objective is to perform a comprehensive review of the last 10 years of literature pertaining to disparities in radiology care. Our secondary objective is to raise awareness of disparities in radiology.','We reviewed English-language medicine and health services literature from the past 10 years (2010-2020) for research that described disparities in any aspect of radiologic imaging using radiology search terms and key words for disparities in OVID. Relevant studies were identified with adherence to the guidelines set forth by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.','The search yielded a total 1,890 articles. We reviewed the citations and abstracts with the initial search yielding 1,890 articles (without duplicates). Of these, 1,776 were excluded based on the criteria set forth in the methods. The remaining unique 114 articles were included for qualitative synthesis.','We hope this article increases awareness and inspires action to address disparities and encourages research that further investigates previously identified disparities and explores not-yet-identified disparities."
"Research has separately established that there are disparities in tobacco use, that greater tobacco retailer density (TRD) is positively associated with tobacco use, and that TRD is greater in high poverty and high racial/ethnic minority neighborhoods. Connecting these topics, this study examined the association between disparities in TRD and disparities in the prevalence of tobacco use among adults and youth. We obtained Ohio data on tobacco use from two statewide adult surveys and two sub-state regional youth surveys (2017-2019). Licensed tobacco retailers in Ohio were geocoded within census tracts. Disparity in TRD within regions across the state was defined as the ratio of TRD in high vs. low poverty (and in high vs. low racial/ethnic minority) census tracts per region. Disparity in cigarette smoking (adults) and any tobacco use (youth) was defined as the ratio of use prevalence among socioeconomically disadvantaged vs. non-disadvantaged (and racial/ethnic minority vs. non-minority) individuals. We estimated Pearson correlation coefficients to assess the linear relationship between the TRD disparity ratios and tobacco use disparity ratios. Poverty-based and race/ethnicity-based TRD disparities were positively associated with smoking disparities among adults. Negative associations between TRD disparities and tobacco use disparities were found among youth. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis directly linking TRD disparities and tobacco use disparities. Different adult and youth findings may be due to trends by age and product preferences. For adults in particular, this analysis suggests a detrimental effect of the tobacco retail environment on disadvantaged populations."
"Health disparities disproportionately affect minority cultural groups (e.g., Indigenous, immigrant, refugee) worldwide; enduring across time, disease states, and risk factors despite co-occurring advancements in health and medicine. Fundamental cause theory holds that important social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, stigma, racism) produce health disparities by restricting equitable access to health-protective resources. Yet, extant literature has not utilized fundamental cause theory to describe the health disparities impact of cultural trauma: an overwhelming, often ongoing physical or psychological assault by an oppressive dominant group on another group's cultural resources through force, threats of force, or oppressive policies. This paper presents a novel conceptual model detailing cultural trauma and the mechanisms through which it may disrupt health and create disparities by damaging three health-protective cultural resources: cultural modes, institutions, and lands. Following cultural trauma, we propose affected groups are socially disadvantaged and exposed to pervasive stress, stigma, and diminished resources, perpetuating health disparities across generations. Consequently, cultural trauma may represent an unrecognized fundamental cause of health disparities, offering potential avenues for promoting health equity through targeted research, interventions, and policies."
"Racial disparities in breast cancer present a vexing and complex challenge for public health. A diverse array of factors contributes to disparities in breast cancer incidence and outcomes, and, thus far, efforts to improve racial equity have yielded mixed results. Systems theory offers a model that is well-suited to addressing complex issues. In particular, the concept of a systemic leverage point offers a clue that may assist researchers, policymakers, and interventionists in formulating innovative and comprehensive approaches to eliminating racial disparities in breast cancer. Naming systemic racism as a fundamental cause of disparities, we use systems theory to identify residential segregation as a key leverage point and a driver of racial inequities across the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. We call on researchers, policymakers, and interventionists to use a systems-informed, community-based participatory approach, aimed at harnessing the power of place, to engage directly with community stakeholders in coordinating efforts to prevent breast cancer, and work toward eliminating disparities in communities of color."
"The Half-Century long problem of addiction treatment disparities. We cannot imagine addressing disparities in addiction treatment without first acknowledging and deconstructing the etiology of this inequity. This article examines the history of addiction treatment disparities beginning with early twentieth-century drug policies. We begin by discussing structural racism, its contribution to treatment disparities, using opioid use disorder as a case study to highlight the importance of a structural competency framework in obtaining care. We conclude by discussing diversity in the workforce as an additional tool to minimizing disparities. Addiction treatment should be aimed at addressing care delivery in the context of the social, economic, and political determinants of health, which require appreciation of their historical origins to move toward equitable treatment."
"Disparities exist in access to a multitude of screening and diagnostic imaging examinations and procedures. To address these disparities within radiology, emphasis so far has been placed upon diversifying the workforce and formally educating trainees on healthcare disparities. Currently, there is no organized and nationally accepted educational program or content for practicing radiologists specific to diversity and healthcare disparity. This void can be addressed by providing an educational curriculum framework for practicing radiologists based on three key factors: individual efforts, calling for institutional change, and national collaboration. Individual efforts should focus on acknowledging the existence of disparities, understanding the contribution of one's implicit bias in perpetuating disparities, understanding and highlighting issues related to insurance coverage of radiology examinations, and participating in radiology political action committees. These efforts can be facilitated by a consolidated web-based training program for practicing radiologists. To pave the way for meaningful systemic change, the implementation of institutional change like that initiated by the Culture of Safety movement in 2002 is needed. A national collaborative effort initiated by radiology organizations to empower radiologists and recognize positive changes would further provide support. SUMMARY: A three-pronged educational framework combining individual radiologist education, institutional change, and national collaboration will enable radiologists to play a role in addressing imaging-related disparities in healthcare."
"High stress is a public health issue in the United States (US), that disproportionately affects socially-marginalized group members, including racial and ethnic minorities and those of low socioeconomic status. While city governments have the potential to reduce stress exposure and health disparities through municipal policies, very little is known about factors that are associated with mayor officials' beliefs about stress as a determinant of disparities. This information is important because it can inform the design of interventions to educate city policymakers about evidence related to stress and health disparities. Using data from a 2016 survey of 230 mayor officials (101 mayors, 129 senior staff), multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the extent to which respondents' individual characteristics (e.g., ideology, highest level of education) and the characteristics of their city's population (e.g., percentage of residents non-white) were associated with their identification of stress as a factor that has a ""very strong effect"" on health disparities. Forty-four percent of respondents identified stress as having a very strong effect on health disparities. In the fully adjusted model, every percentage point increase in the proportion of a respondent's city population that was non-White increased the odds of identifying stress as having a very strong effect on health disparities by 2% [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00,1.04]. Interventions are needed to increase city policymakers' knowledge about the role of stress in the production of health disparities, which could, in turn, help cultivate political will for city policies that reduce disparities."
"Health systems and providers across America are increasingly employing telehealth technologies to better serve medically underserved low-income, minority, and rural populations at the highest risk for health disparities. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has invested US $386 million in comparative effectiveness research in telehealth, yet little is known about the key early lessons garnered from this research regarding the best practices in using telehealth to address disparities.','This paper describes preliminary lessons from the body of research using study findings and case studies drawn from PCORI seminal patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) initiatives. The primary purpose was to identify common barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth technologies in populations at risk for disparities.','A systematic scoping review of telehealth studies addressing disparities was performed. It was guided by the Arksey and O'Malley Scoping Review Framework and focused on PCORI's active portfolio of telehealth studies and key PCOR identified by study investigators. We drew on this broad literature using illustrative examples from early PCOR experience and published literature to assess barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth in populations at risk for disparities, using the active implementation framework to extract data. Major themes regarding how telehealth interventions can overcome barriers to telehealth adoption and implementation were identified through this review using an iterative Delphi process to achieve consensus among the PCORI investigators participating in the study.','PCORI has funded 89 comparative effectiveness studies in telehealth, of which 41 assessed the use of telehealth to improve outcomes for populations at risk for health disparities. These 41 studies employed various overlapping modalities including mobile devices (29/41, 71%), web-based interventions (30/41, 73%), real-time videoconferencing (15/41, 37%), remote patient monitoring (8/41, 20%), and store-and-forward (ie, asynchronous electronic transmission) interventions (4/41, 10%). The studies targeted one or more of PCORI's priority populations, including racial and ethnic minorities (31/41, 41%), people living in rural areas, and those with low income/low socioeconomic status, low health literacy, or disabilities. Major themes identified across these studies included the importance of patient-centered design, cultural tailoring of telehealth solutions, delivering telehealth through trusted intermediaries, partnering with payers to expand telehealth reimbursement, and ensuring confidential sharing of private information.','Early PCOR evidence suggests that the most effective health system- and provider-level telehealth implementation solutions to address disparities employ patient-centered and culturally tailored telehealth solutions whose development is actively guided by the patients themselves to meet the needs of specific communities and populations. Further, this evidence shows that the best practices in telehealth implementation include delivery of telehealth through trusted intermediaries, close partnership with payers to facilitate reimbursement and sustainability, and safeguards to ensure patient-guided confidential sharing of personal health information."
"Measuring and improving equitable access to care is a necessity to achieve universal health coverage. Pre-pandemic estimates showed that most conflict-affected and fragile situations were off-track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals on health and equity by 2030. Yet, there is a paucity of studies examining health inequalities in these settings. This study addresses the literature gap by applying a conflict intensity lens to the analysis of disparities in access to essential Primary Health Care (PHC) services in four conflict-affected fragile states: Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali and Nigeria.','For each studied country, disparities in geographic and financial access to care were compared across education and wealth strata in areas with differing levels of conflict intensity. The Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program were the main sources of information on access to PHC and conflict events, respectively. To define conflict intensity, household clusters were linked to conflict events within a 50-km distance. A cut-off of more than two conflict-related deaths per 100,000 population was used to differentiate medium or high intensity conflict from no or low intensity conflict. We utilized three measures to assess inequalities: an absolute difference, a concentration index, and a multivariate logistic regression coefficient. Each disparity measure was compared based on the intensity of conflict the year the DHS data was collected.','We found that PHC access varied across subnational regions in the four countries studied; with more prevalent financial than geographic barriers to care. The magnitude of both educational and wealth disparities in access to care was higher with geographic proximity to medium or high intensity conflict. A higher magnitude of wealth rather than educational disparities was also likely to be observed in the four studied contexts. Meanwhile, only Nigeria showed statistically significant interaction between conflict intensity and educational disparities in access to care.','Both educational and wealth disparities in access to PHC services can be exacerbated by geographic proximity to organized violence. This paper provides additional evidence that, despite limitations, household surveys can contribute to healthcare assessment in conflict-affected and fragile settings."
"Effective healthcare disparities curricula seek to train physicians who are well equipped to address the health needs of an increasingly diverse society. Current literature on healthcare disparities curricula and implementation focuses on courses created independent of existing educational materials. Our aim was to develop and implement a novel resource-conserving healthcare disparities curriculum to enhance existing medical school lectures without the need for additional lectures.','This non-randomized intervention was conducted at the University of California Los Angeles. The curriculum was offered to all first-year medical students in the class of 2021 (n=188). With institutional approval, a new healthcare disparities curriculum was created based on the Society of General Internal Medicine's core learning objectives for effective healthcare disparities curricula (J General Internal Med 25:S160-163, 2010). Implementation of the curriculum made use of ""teachable moments"" within existing medical school lectures. Teachable moments were broad lecture topics identified by the research team as suitable for introducing relevant healthcare disparities content. The new lecture-enhancing healthcare disparities curriculum was delivered with the related lecture via integrated PDF documents uploaded to an online learning management system. Students were encouraged to complete pre- and post- course assessments to examine changes in disparities knowledge and self-rated confidence in addressing disparities. Matched χ2 tests were used for statistical analysis.','Participating students (n=92) completed both pre- and post-course assessments and were retrospectively stratified, based on self-reported use of the new lecture enhancing curriculum, into the ""high utilizer"" group (use of materials ""sometimes"" or ""very often,"" n=52) and the comparison ""low utilizer"" group (use of the materials ""rarely"" or ""very rarely,"" n=40). Students who self-identified as underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities in medicine were more likely to utilize the material (41% of the high utilizers vs. 17% of the low utilizer group, p<.01). Post-course knowledge assessment scores and self-reported confidence in addressing healthcare disparities improved only in the high utilizer group.','Integrating new guideline based curricula content simultaneously into pre-existing lectures by identifying and harnessing teachable moments may be an effective and resource-conserving strategy for enhancing healthcare disparities education among first year medical students."
"Health literacy (HL)-as a broad range of health-related competencies-has been proposed to be a promising construct in understanding health disparities better, also among adolescents. Several factors have been found to explain differences in adolescents' HL levels; however, not much is known about how different regions of a country or majority/minority status is associated with HL, or whether HL is associated with regional health disparities. The aim of this study was to examine and compare HL and health levels among majority- and minority-language-speaking adolescents living in different regions of Finland, and to explore if HL explains regional health disparities, taking into account other important structural stratifying factors. The study uses Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey data, collected among 13- and 15-year-old pupils in Finnish- and Swedish-speaking schools in Finland in 2014 (N = 3853/1123; 85/83%). Findings suggest that regional differences in HL levels and regional health disparities exist in both language groups. Health disparities were present in the Finnish-speaking sample among boys, the proportion rating their health as excellent ranging from 23 to 31% across regions, and in the Swedish-speaking sample among girls, the corresponding numbers ranging from 13 to 20%. In addition to other important structural stratifying factors, comprehensive HL explains these regional health disparities. This study adds to prior studies on the role of HL as a modifiable health resource by showing that regional health disparities among adolescents can partially be attributed to corresponding HL differences."
"To determine whether disparities exist in the nutritional quality of packaged foods and beverage purchases by household income, education and race/ethnicity and if they changed over time.','We used Nielsen Homescan, a nationally representative household panel, from 2008 to 2018 (n = 672 821 household-year observations). Multivariate, multilevel regressions were used to model the association between sociodemographic groups and a set of nutritional outcomes of public health interest, including nutrients of concern (sugar, saturated fat and Na) and calories from specific food groups (fruits, non-starchy vegetables, processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and junk foods).','Household panel survey.','Approximately 60 000 households each year from the USA.','Disparities were found by income and education for most outcomes and widened for purchases of fruits, vegetables and the percentage of calories from sugar between 2008 and 2018. The magnitude of disparities was largest by education. Disparities between Black and White households include the consumption of processed meats and the percentage of calories from sugar, while no disparities were found between White and Hispanic households. Disparities have been largely persistent, as any significant changes over time have been substantively small.','Policies to improve the healthfulness of packaged foods must be expanded beyond SSB taxes, and future research should focus on what mediates the relationship between education and diet so as not to exacerbate disparities."
"<b>Background:</b> There is a critical need to address mental health needs across the globe, especially in low and middle-income countries where mental health disparities are pervasive, including among children. The global mental health disparities suggest an imperative for culturally and contextually-congruent mental health services models that expand upon the existing services and interventions for these groups. Rigorous research is a key tool in providing the scientific evidence to inform public policy and practice efforts to effectively address these needs. Yet, there is a limited number of researchers, especially those from diverse backgrounds, who study these issues. In this paper, we describe the ""<i>Training</i> <b><i>LEAD</i></b> <i>ers to Accelerate Global Mental Health Disparities Research""</i> (LEAD) program, a research training program funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and focused on global mental health disparities research for early career researchers from under-represented minority groups. <b>Methods:</b> The LEAD program is designed as a two-phase training program for advanced pre-doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty from diverse backgrounds in the U.S., including groups underrepresented in biomedical, behavioral, clinical and social sciences research, interested in global mental health disparities research. Trainees are matched with mentors and participate in an intensive 12-week program. <b>Discussion:</b> The LEAD program seeks to provide a robust platform for the development, implementation and expansion of evidence-based culturally and contextually-congruent interventions and services models addressing global mental health disparities across the life cycle, especially in low-resource communities in the global context. By producing a sustainable network of well-trained investigators from underrepresented backgrounds, LEAD will potentially contribute to the shared lessons and efforts relevant to addressing global mental health disparities and improving care for vulnerable populations in low-resource settings."
"The quality of end-of-life (EOL) care in the USA remains suboptimal, with significant variations in care by race and across disease subgroups. Patient-provider communication may contribute to racial and disease-specific variations in EOL care outcomes.','We examined racial disparities in EOL care, by disease group (cancer vs. non-cancer), and assessed whether racial differences in patient-provider communication accounted for observed disparities.','Retrospective cohort study using the 2001-2015 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results - Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems data linked with Medicare claims (SEER-CAHPS). We employed stratified propensity score matching and modified Poisson regression analyses, adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics PARTICIPANTS: Black and White Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older with cancer (N=2000) or without cancer (N=11,524).','End-of-life care measures included hospice use, inpatient hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and emergency department (ED) visits, during the 90 days prior to death.','When considering all conditions together (cancer + non-cancer), Black beneficiaries were 26% less likely than their Whites counterparts to enroll in hospice (adjusted risk ratio [ARR]: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.66-0.83). Among beneficiaries without cancer, Black beneficiaries had a 32% lower likelihood of enrolling in hospice (ARR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.59-0.79). There was no racial difference in hospice enrollment among cancer patients. Black beneficiaries were also at increased risk for ED use (ARR: 1.12, 95%CI: 1.01-1.26). Patient-provider communication did not explain racial disparities in hospice or ED use. There were no racial differences in hospitalizations or ICU admissions.','We observed racial disparities in hospice use and ED visits in the 90 days prior to death among Medicare beneficiaries; however, hospice disparities were largely driven by patients without cancer. Condition-specific differences in palliative care integration at the end-of-life may partly account for variations in EOL care disparities across disease groups."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported disproportionate health disparities with respect to disease for Blacks/African Americans (AAs) compared to Whites in the USA. In this paper, we identify and compare the factors involved in creating these disparities among these populations during the 2009 H1N1 and current COVID-19 pandemics.','We included studies describing health disparities towards Blacks/AAs in the USA during the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics. Only observational empirical studies with free full-text availability in English from PubMed, PubMed Central and Google Scholar were included.','A total of 31 papers were included: 19 pertaining to the H1N1 pandemic and 12 to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative analysis for health disparities resulted in 43 different factors, which were subdivided into nine overarching themes.','The similarities that exist between the two pandemics indicate that there are many neglected issues in American healthcare that need to be addressed. The listed factors have led to disparities in screening and treating for disease resulting in disparities in infection rates, severity of illness and mortality. This calls for a change in healthcare dynamics to improve access to healthcare, remove any form of possible discrimination, and regain the lost trust with the Black/AA communities, repairing historical damage.','Effective utilisation of social media and faith-based centres to educate patients, implementation of new policies improving access to healthcare, and culture-sensitive education for healthcare providers are suggested to decrease health disparities and improve health outcomes across the USA."
"Over the past five decades in the United States, White women have breastfed at higher rates than Black women. While a small but growing body of social historical research has examined racial disparities in breastfeeding over time, empirical research, particularly quantitative research, has focused on single historical snapshots, unintentionally treating the persistent racial disparities in breastfeeding as a static phenomenon, rather than one with distinct social mechanisms at different points in time. Further, few studies on racial disparities in health deconstruct difference both within and across racial groups. But what if we thought about persistent racial disparities instead as discrete trends with distinct social mechanisms at different points in time? In a binary logistic regression of breastfeeding initiation rates from 1973 to 2015 using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), I found that the persistent racial disparities were actually comprised of three distinct types of changing racial disparities: (1) increases in racial disparities that derive from improvements for Whites not captured by Blacks (1973-1982); (2) decreases in racial disparities that stem from improvements for Whites captured even more strongly by Blacks (1995-2006); and, (3) leveling off of racial disparities (2006-2015). Placing results of this quantitative analysis within the context of public policy and social movement history, I identify three distinct mechanisms that drive the different trends in racial disparities in breastfeeding. This paper contributes to the literature on motherhood, race, and health a more nuanced understanding of the social historical mechanisms that pattern breastfeeding, and more broadly, racial disparities in health."
"Unacceptable healthcare disparities in endocrine disease have persisted for decades, and 2021 presents a difficult evolving environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the gross structural inequities that drive health disparities, and antiracism demonstrations remind us that the struggle for human rights continues. Increased public awareness and discussion of disparities present an urgent opportunity to advance health equity. However, it is more complicated to change the behavior of individuals and reform systems because societies are polarized into different factions that increasingly believe, accept, and live different realities. To reduce health disparities, clinicians must (1) truly commit to advancing health equity and intentionally act to reduce health disparities; (2) create a culture of equity by looking inwards for personal bias and outwards for the systemic biases built into their everyday work processes; (3) implement practical individual, organizational, and community interventions that address the root causes of the disparities; and (4) consider their roles in addressing social determinants of health and influencing healthcare payment policy to advance health equity. To care for diverse populations in 2021, clinicians must have self-insight and true understanding of heterogeneous patients, knowledge of evidence-based interventions, ability to adapt messaging and approaches, and facility with systems change and advocacy. Advancing health equity requires both science and art; evidence-based roadmaps and stories that guide the journey to better outcomes, judgment that informs how to change the behavior of patients, providers, communities, organizations, and policymakers, and passion and a moral mission to serve humanity."
"Internet access is increasingly critical for adolescents with regard to obtaining health information and resources, participating in web-based health promotion, and communicating with health practitioners. However, past work demonstrates that access is not uniform among youth in the United States, with lower access found among groups with higher health-related needs. Population-level data yield important insights about access and internet use in the United States.','The aim of this study is to examine internet access and mode of access by social class and race and ethnicity among youth (aged 14-17 years) in the United States.','Using the Current Population Survey, we examined internet access, cell phone or smartphone access, and modes of connecting to the internet for adolescents in 2015 (unweighted N=6950; expanded weights N=17,103,547) and 2017 (unweighted N=6761; expanded weights N=17,379,728).','Internet access increased from 2015 to 2017, but socioeconomic status (SES) and racial and ethnic disparities remained. In 2017, the greatest disparities were found for youth in low-income households (no home access=23%) and for Black youth (no home access=18%) and Hispanic youth (no home access=14%). Low-income Black and Hispanic youth were the most likely to lack home internet access (no home access, low SES Black youth=29%; low SES Hispanic youth=21%). The mode of access (eg, from home and smartphone) and smartphone-only analyses also revealed disparities.','Without internet access, web-based dissemination of information, health promotion, and health care will not reach a significant segment of youth. Currently, SES and racial and ethnic disparities in access prolong health inequalities. Moreover, the economic impact of COVID-19 on Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities may lead to losses in internet access for youth that will further exacerbate disparities."
"Healthcare disparities negatively impact patient health outcomes; addressing disparities could improve quality of life and decrease overall healthcare cost. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is an objective and reliable source for collecting information on United States (U.S.) ambulatory medical care service visits and may be a useful tool for identifying potential disparities in care.','The purpose of this literature review is to describe studies utilizing NAMCS to capture U.S. healthcare disparities.','PubMed was searched for scientific articles that utilized NAMCS to determine health disparities in the U.S. The keywords queried included ""NAMCS"" or ""National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey"" and ""disparity"" or ""disparities"" as a pair or additionally paired with one of the following: ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""age"", ""gender"", ""geography"", or ""insurance"".','66 studies were found that incorporated NAMCS data from 1980-2016 into their methods to measure outcomes relating to health disparities. Disparities were found in the following categories: race/ethnicity, geographic location, age, insurance type, gender, specialist care versus primary care, body habitus, and preexisting conditions affecting patient outcomes. Disparities were identified in pain management, neurology, dermatology, psychiatry, patient communication access, and non-specialty specific or primary care visits related to disease conditions, screening, and treatment plans.','Only PubMed was utilized as a search engine and may not encompass all studies on NAMCS and health disparities. NAMCS is a cross-sectional database and does not allow for longitudinal analyses.','NAMCS may be an underused tool given the limited number of articles that identify health disparities using it. Research studies utilizing NAMCS may identify potential disparities ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes."
"There has been a lack of evidence on whether there are racial and ethnic disparities in medication nonadherence among individuals receiving comprehensive medication review (CMR), a required component of the Medicare Part D medication therapy management (MTM) services.','To explore racial/ethnic disparities in medication nonadherence among older MTM enrollees who received a CMR and to determine how much the identified disparities can be explained by observed characteristics.','The retrospective study used 100% of the 2017 Medicare claims, including MTM data. Linked Area Health Resources Files provided community characteristics. Nonadherence was defined as proportion of days covered <80%, and was measured for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia medications. Racial/ethnic disparities were examined by logistic regressions that included racial/ethnic minority dummy variables. A nonlinear Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was applied to decompose the identified disparities.','Compared with non-Hispanic Whites (Whites), Blacks were respectively 39% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-1.45), 27% (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.22-1.32), and 43% (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.39-1.47) more likely to be nonadherent to diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia medications; Hispanics were 20% (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.14-1.27) more likely to be nonadherent to hyperlipidemia medications. The total portion of disparity explained was 13.42%, 7.66%, 14.87%, and 10.69% respectively for disparities in Black-White (B-W) diabetes, B-W hypertension, B-W hyperlipidemia, and Hispanic-White hyperlipidemia. The top three contributors were the proportion of married-couple families, census region, and male gender.','A lower level of community affluence and social support, regional variations, and a lower proportion of males in Blacks and Hispanics may contribute to the disparities in medication nonadherence. The large unexplained portion of the disparity attests that nonadherence is a complex issue. The Medicare MTM program needs to implement measures to reduce disparities in medication adherence."
"Existing evidence for disparities in inflammatory bowel disease is fragmented and heterogenous. Underlying mechanisms for differences in outcomes based on race and socioeconomic status remain undefined. We performed a systematic review of the literature to examine disparities in surgery for inflammatory bowel disease in the United States.','Electronic databases were searched from 2000 through June 11, 2021, to identify studies addressing disparities in surgical treatment for adults with inflammatory bowel disease. Eligible English-language publications comparing the use or outcomes of surgery by racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, geographic, and/or institutional factors were included. Studies were grouped according to whether outcomes of surgery were reported or surgery itself was the relevant end point (utilization). Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies.','Forty-five studies were included. Twenty-four reported surgical outcomes and 21addressed utilization. Race/ethnicity was considered in 96% of studies, socioeconomic status in 44%, geographic factors in 27%, and hospital/surgeon factors in 22%. Although study populations and end points were heterogeneous, Black and Hispanic patients were less likely to undergo abdominal surgery when hospitalized; they were more likely to have a complication when they did have surgery. Differences based on race were correlated with socioeconomic factors but frequently remained significant after adjustments for insurance and baseline health.','Surgical disparities based on sociologic and structural factors reflect unidentified differences in multidisciplinary disease management. A broad, multidimensional approach to disparities research with more granular and diverse data sources is needed to improve health care quality and equity for inflammatory bowel disease."
"Emerging research suggests that sleep contributes to racial disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by poor cardiovascular outcomes including obesity, hypertension and diabetes. Although circadian rhythms affect sleep patterns, few studies have examined disparities in circadian health or the contribution of circadian disparities to CVD. In this paper, we provide an overview of the relation between circadian health and CVD in the context of health disparities. We discuss (1) the current knowledge on racial disparities in circadian health; (2) social and environmental determinants of circadian health disparities; (3) the cardiovascular consequences of circadian disparities; and (4) future opportunities to advance the field of circadian disparities. In brief, our findings demonstrated that among a small literature, racial minorities (mainly African American) were more likely to have a shorter circadian period, delayed phase shifts, and were more likely to be shift workers, which are associated with CVD risk factors. Given racial minorities are disproportionately affected by CVD and CVD risk factors, it is important to further understand circadian health as an intervention target and support more research among racial minorities to understand circadian health in these populations."
"Background In the United States, large disparities in cardiovascular health (CVH) exist in the general population, but little is known about the CVH status and its disparities among women of childbearing age (ie, 18-49 years). Methods and Results In this cross-sectional study, we examined racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities in CVH among all women of childbearing age in the United States, using the 2011 to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Life's Simple 7 (ie, blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, and diet) was used to examine CVH. Women with 7 ideal CVH metrics were determined to have ideal CVH. Among the 269 564 women of childbearing age, 13 800 (4.84%) had ideal CVH. After adjusting for potential confounders, non-Hispanic Black women were less likely to have ideal CVH (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46-0.63) compared with non-Hispanic White women, and with significantly lower odds of having ideal metrics of blood pressure, blood glucose, body mass index, and physical activity. No significant difference in CVH was found between non-Hispanic White and Hispanic women. Large geographic disparities with temporal variations were observed, with the age- and race-adjusted ideal CVH prevalence ranging from 4.05% in the District of Columbia (2011) to 5.55% in Maine and Montana (2019). States with low ideal CVH prevalence and average CVH score were mostly clustered in the southern United States. Conclusions Large racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities in CVH exist among women of childbearing age. More efforts are warranted to understand and address these disparities."
"Policy Points Mayoral officials' opinions about the existence and fairness of health disparities in their city are positively associated with the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity in their city. Associations between mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their city and the magnitude of life expectancy disparity in their city are not moderated by the social or fiscal ideology of mayoral officials or the ideology of their constituents. Highly visible and publicized information about mortality disparities, such as that related to COVID-19 disparities, has potential to elevate elected officials' perceptions of the severity of health disparities and influence their opinions about the issue.','A substantive body of research has explored what factors influence elected officials' opinions about health issues. However, no studies have assessed the potential influence of the health of an elected official's constituents. We assessed whether the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity within a city was associated with the opinions of that city's mayoral official (i.e., mayor or deputy mayor) about health disparities in their city.','The independent variable was the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity in US cities. The magnitude was determined by linking 2010-2015 estimates of life expectancy and median household income for 8,434 census tracts in 224 cities. The dependent variables were mayoral officials' opinions from a 2016 survey about the existence and fairness of health disparities in their city (n = 224, response rate 30.3%). Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for characteristics of mayoral officials (e.g., ideology) and city characteristics.','In cities in the highest income-based life expectancy disparity quartile, 50.0% of mayoral officials ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 52.7% believed health disparities were ""very unfair."" In comparison, among mayoral officials in cities in the lowest disparity quartile 33.9% ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 22.2% believed the disparities were ""very unfair."" A 1-year-larger income-based life expectancy disparity in a city was associated with 25% higher odds that the city's mayoral official would ""strongly agree"" that health disparities existed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; P = .04) and twice the odds that the city's mayoral official would believe that such disparities were ""very unfair"" (OR = 2.24; P <.001).','Mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their jurisdictions are generally aligned with, and potentially influenced by, information about the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparities among their constituents."
"Although disparities in COVID-19 mortality have been documented at the national and state levels, no previous study has quantified such disparities at the county level by explicitly measuring race-specific COVID-19 death rates. In this paper, we quantify the racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality between the non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White populations at the county level by estimating age-adjusted, race-specific death rates.','Using COVID-19 case data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we calculated crude and indirect age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates for the non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations in each of 353 counties for the period February 2, 2020, through January 30, 2021. Using linear regression analysis, we examined the relationship between several county-level measures of structural racism and the observed differences in racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across counties.','Ninety-three percent of the counties in our study experienced higher death rates among the Black compared to the White population, with an average ratio of Black to White death rates of 1.9 and a 17.5-fold difference between the disparity in the lowest and highest counties. Three traditional measures of structural racism were significantly related to the magnitude of the Black-White racial disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates across counties.','There are large disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates between the Black and White populations at the county level, there are profound differences in the level of these disparities, and those differences are directly related to the level of structural racism in a given county."
"Sleep deficiencies, which include insufficient or long sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and irregular timing of sleep, are disproportionately distributed among populations that experience health disparities in the United States. Sleep deficiencies are associated with a wide range of suboptimal health outcomes, high-risk health behaviors, and poorer overall functioning and well-being. This report focuses on sleep health disparities (SHDs), which is a term defined as differences in one or more dimensions of sleep health on a consistent basis that adversely affect designated disadvantaged populations. SHDs appear to share many of the same determinants and causal pathways observed for health outcomes with well-known disparities. There also appears to be common behavioral and biological mechanisms that connect sleep with poorer health outcomes, suggesting a link between SHDs and other health disparities observed within these designated populations. In 2018, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research convened a workshop with experts in sleep, circadian rhythms, and health disparities to identify research gaps, challenges, and opportunities to better understand and advance research to address SHDs. The major strategy to address SHDs is to promote integration between health disparity causal pathways and sleep and circadian-related mechanisms in research approaches and study designs. Additional strategies include developing a comprehensive, integrative conceptual model, building transdisciplinary training and research infrastructure, and designing as well as testing multilevel, multifactorial interventions to address SHDs."
"The dementia experience is not a monolithic phenomenon-and while core elements of dementia are considered universal-people living with dementia experience the disorder differently. Understanding the patterning of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the population with regards to incidence, risk factors, impacts on dementia care, and economic costs associated with ADRD can provide clues to target risk and protective factors for all populations as well as addressing health disparities.','We discuss information presented at the 2020 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers, Theme 1: Impact of Dementia. In this article, we describe select population trends, care interventions, and economic impacts, health disparities and implications for future research from the perspective of our diverse panel comprised of academic stakeholders, and persons living with dementia, and care partners.','Dementia incidence is decreasing yet the advances in population health are uneven. Studies examining the educational, geographic and race/ethnic distribution of ADRD have identified clear disparities. Disparities in health and healthcare may be amplified by significant gaps in the evidence base for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The economic costs for persons living with dementia and the value of family care partners' time are high, and may persist into future generations.','Significant research gaps remain. Ensuring that ADRD healthcare services and long-term care services and supports are accessible, affordable, and effective for all segments of our population is essential for health equity. Policy-level interventions are in short supply to redress broad unmet needs and systemic sources of disparities. Whole of society challenges demand research producing whole of society solutions. The urgency, complexity, and scale merit a ""whole of government"" approach involving collaboration across numerous federal agencies."
"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted consistent inequities in incidence, disease severity, and mortality across racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States (US) and beyond. While similar patterns have been observed with previous viral respiratory pathogens, to date, no systematic review has comprehensively documented these disparities or potential contributing factors. In response, this review aims to synthesize data on racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality due to viral acute respiratory infections (ARI) other than SARS-CoV-2. This review will focus on understanding structural health and social factors to contextualize race and ethnicity driving these disparities in the US.','We will conduct a systematic review of studies published from January 1, 2002, onward. Our search will include PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO Host-CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to identify relevant articles. We will include studies of any design that describe racial/ethnic disparities associated with viral ARI conducted in the US. Primary outcomes include incidence, disease severity or complication, hospitalization, or death attributed to ARI. Secondary outcomes include uptake of preventive interventions including vaccination, handwashing, social distancing, and wearing masks. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract relevant data. Data characterizing individual-, community-, and structural-level factors associated with these disparities will be abstracted to better understand the underlying structural inequities contributing to racial disparities in ARI. We will assess the methodological quality of all studies and will conduct meta-analyses using random effects models if appropriate.','Findings from this systematic review will shed light on patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in viral ARI in the United States to support mathematical modeling of epidemic trajectories, intervention impact, and structural drivers of transmission, including structural racism. Moreover, data emerging from this review may reignite pandemic preparedness focused on communities with specific vulnerabilities related to living and working conditions given prevailing structural inequities, thus facilitating improved future pandemic responses to novel or endemic viral respiratory pathogens.','PROSPERO CRD42020219771."
"Health care organizations have a responsibility to reduce racial and ethnic perinatal health disparities. In the United States, Black women experience the worst perinatal outcomes. The process for successfully addressing this problem in clinical practice remains unclear.','A community hospital implemented components of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health Reduction of Peripartum Racial/Ethnic Disparities Patient Safety Bundle. The purpose was to collect and share perinatal disparities data, increase staff awareness of perinatal racial and ethnic disparities, and engage staff to address these disparities at the project site. Perinatal care data were reviewed by race and ethnicity and results were shared with staff. Staff were engaged through a series of activities including a Health Equity Party, implicit bias workshop, Snack and Learn sessions, online modules, 2 grand rounds, and the establishment of a Health Equity Committee.','Racial and/or ethnic disparities were identified for perinatal outcomes and experience of care indicators including rates of cesarean birth, newborn mortality, and 30-day readmission. Of the staff 137 (65.9%) participated in project activities. The majority of participants were registered nurses (n = 82). Certified nurse-midwives (n = 10) were the profession with the highest rate of attendance (83.3%). Staff developed 26 new recommendations to address racial and ethnic disparities in care. After project implementation, mean scores of High Provider Attribution, an indicator of readiness to address health disparities, increased from preimplementation scores (P = .01). There was also a significant increase in the number of staff who reported engaging in activities to address the health care needs of racial and ethnic minority patients (P < .001).','This quality improvement project demonstrated that interventions at the health care organization level can be effective in influencing health care providers and staff to address racial and ethnic perinatal disparities."
"Major changes were made to the U.S. kidney allocation system (KAS) on December 4, 2014, in the effort to address disparities in kidney transplantation (KT) and achieve equity in organ allocation. Research is necessary to examine whether KAS achieved its goal; first, a firm understanding of the disparities that existed prior to implementation of KAS is needed. This systematic review examined the literature on disparities in access to deceased donor KT (DDKT) after listing in the pre-KAS era and discussed mechanisms to explain these disparities. Thirty-two articles were included. Racial, gender, age, socioeconomic, physiologic, geographic, and health care system disparities existed in the pre-KAS era. Findings of this review will inform the agenda for future disparities research in the post-KAS era."
"Maternal mortality is higher among Black than White people in the United States. Whether Black-White disparities in maternal in-hospital mortality during the delivery hospitalization vary across hospital types (Black-serving vs nonBlack-serving and teaching vs nonteaching) and whether overall maternal mortality differs across hospital types is not known.','The aims of this study were to determine whether risk-adjusted Black-White disparities in maternal mortality during the delivery hospitalization vary by hospital types (this is analysis of disparities in mortality within hospital types) and compare risk-adjusted in-hospital maternal mortality among Black-serving and nonBlack-serving teaching and nonteaching hospitals regardless of race (this is an analysis of overall mortality across hospital types).','We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 5,679,044 deliveries among Black (14.2%) and White patients (85.8%) in 3 states (California, Missouri, and Pennsylvania) from 1995 to 2009. A hospital discharge disposition of ""death"" defined maternal in-hospital mortality. Black-serving hospitals had at least 7% Black obstetrical patients (top quartile). We performed risk adjustment by calculating expected death rates using predictions from logistic regression models incorporating sociodemographics, rurality, comorbidities, multiple gestations, gestational age at delivery, year, state, and mode of delivery. We calculated risk-adjusted risk ratios of mortality by comparing observed-to-expected ratios among Black and White patients within hospital types and then examined mortality across hospital types, regardless of patient race. We quantified the proportion of Black-White disparities in mortality attributable to delivering in Black-serving hospitals using causal mediation analysis.','There were 330 maternal deaths among 5,679,044 patients (5.8 per 100,000). Black patients died more often (11.5 per 100,000) than White patients (4.8 per 100,000) (relative risk, 2.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-2.98). Examination of Black-White disparities revealed that after risk adjustment, Black patients had significantly greater risk of death (adjusted relative risk, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.79) and that the disparity was similar within each of the hospital types. Comparison of mortality, regardless of race, across hospital types revealed that among teaching hospitals, mortality was similar in Black-serving and nonBlack-serving hospitals. However, among nonteaching hospitals, mortality was significantly higher in Black-serving vs nonBlack-serving hospitals (adjusted relative risk, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.87). Notably, 53% of Black patients delivered in nonteaching, Black-serving hospitals compared with just 19% of White patients. Among nonteaching hospitals, 47% of Black-White disparities in maternal in-hospital mortality were attributable to delivering at Black-serving hospitals.','Maternal in-hospital mortality during the delivery hospitalization among Black patients is more than double that of White patients. Our data suggest this disparity is caused by excess mortality among Black patients within each hospital type, in addition to excess mortality in nonteaching, Black-serving hospitals where most Black patients deliver. Addressing downstream effects of racism to achieve equity in maternal in-hospital mortality will require transparent reporting of quality metrics by race to reduce differential care and outcomes within hospital types, improvements in care delivery at Black-serving hospitals, overcoming barriers to accessing high-quality care among Black patients, and eventually desegregation of healthcare."
"Racial and ethnic as well as economic disparities in access to care among persons with asthma and COPD have been described, but long-term access trends are unclear.','Have health coverage and access to care and medications among adults with airways disease improved, and have disparities narrowed?','Using the 1997 through 2018 National Health Interview Survey, we examined time trends in health coverage and the affordability of medical care and prescription drugs for adults with asthma and COPD, overall and by income and by race and ethnicity. We performed multivariate linear probability regressions comparing coverage and access in 2018 with that in 1997.','Our sample included 76,843 adults with asthma and 30,548 adults with COPD. Among adults with asthma, lack of insurance rose in the first decade of the twenty-first century, peaking with the Great Recession, but fell after implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). From 1997 through 2018, the uninsured rate among adults with asthma decreased from 19.4% to 9.6% (adjusted 9.27 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.1%-11.5%). However, the proportions delaying or foregoing medical care because of cost or going without medications did not improve. Racial and ethnic as well as economic disparities present in 1997 persisted over the study period. Trends and disparities among those with COPD were similar, although the proportion going without needed medications worsened, rising by an adjusted 7.8 percentage points.','Coverage losses among persons with airways disease in the first decade of the twenty-first century were reversed by the ACA, but neither care affordability nor disparities improved. Further reform is needed to close these gaps."
"Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the incidence of Legionnaires' disease have been documented for the past 2 decades; however, the social determinants of health (SDH) that contribute to these disparities are not well studied. The objective of this narrative review was to characterize SDH to inform efforts to reduce disparities in the incidence of Legionnaires' disease.','We conducted a narrative review of articles published from January 1979 through October 2019 that focused on disparities in the incidence of Legionnaires' disease and pneumonia (inclusive of bacterial pneumonia and/or community-acquired pneumonia) among adults and children (excluding articles that were limited to people aged <18 years). We identified 220 articles, of which 19 met our criteria: original research, published in English, and examined Legionnaires' disease or pneumonia, health disparities, and SDH. We organized findings using the Healthy People 2030 SDH domains: economic stability, education access and quality, social and community context, health care access and quality, and neighborhood and built environment.','Of the 19 articles reviewed, multiple articles examined disparities in incidence of Legionnaires' disease and pneumonia related to economic stability/income (n = 13) and comorbidities (n = 10), and fewer articles incorporated SDH variables related to education (n = 3), social support (none), health care access (n = 1), and neighborhood and built environment (n = 6) in their analyses.','Neighborhood and built-environment factors such as housing, drinking water infrastructure, and pollutant exposures represent critical partnership and research opportunities. More research that incorporates SDH and multilevel, cross-sector interventions is needed to address disparities in Legionnaires' disease incidence."
"The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) was established in 2001 with the purpose of confronting and eliminating cancer health disparities, while increasing workforce diversity in cancer research. Over the last two decades, CRCHD has generated a broad range of research, training, and community outreach activities to address these overarching goals through a variety of programs including the Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences (CURE), Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity (PACHE), Special Populations Networks (SPN), Community Networks Program (CNP), CNP Centers (CNPC), and Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP). CRCHD, through its CURE and now its Intramural CURE (iCURE) programs, has been fully dedicated to training the next generation of competitive researchers from backgrounds typically underrepresented in the cancer and cancer health disparities research fields. Today, CRCHD leads NCI's efforts in supporting research training and career development experiences beginning as early as middle school and continuing through to tenured track appointments. CRCHD has also developed a robust basic research focus in cancer disparities, which has recently expanded into translational disparities research and the generation of novel, authenticated animal models appropriate for advancing disparities research investigations. Additionally, CRCHD has fostered an integrated networks infrastructure to complement and support its disparities research and diversity training efforts, as well as provide cancer education and outreach among racially and ethnically diverse and medically underserved communities. Moving forward, the CRCHD will continue its steadfast efforts to move us closer to the day when diversity is a given and disparities no longer exist."
"To assess the causative factors that contribute to racial disparities in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and establish the role of hospital factors in racial disparities.','Retrospective database analysis.','Patients with surgically treated HNSCC were identified using the National Cancer Database (2004-2014). Logistic and proportional-hazard regression models were used to characterize the factors that contribute to racial disparities. Differences in quality of care received were compared among black and white patients using previously validated metrics.','We identified 69,186 eligible patients. Black patients had a 48% higher mortality than white patients (HR 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-1.54). Black patients had a lower mean quality score (67.6%; 95% CI, 66.8%-69.4%) compared with white patients (71.2%: 95% CI, 71.0%-71.4%) for five quality metrics. After adjusting for differences in patient, oncologic, and hospital factors we were able to explain 60% of the excess mortality for black patients. Oncologic factors at presentation accounted for 57.7% of observed mortality differences, whereas hospital characteristics and quality of care accounted for 11.5%. After adjusting for these factors, black patients still had a 19% higher mortality (HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14-1.24).','Oncologic factors at presentation are a major contributor to racial disparities in outcomes for HNSCC. Hospital factors, such as quality, volume, and safety-net status, constitute a minor factor in the mortality difference.

"Care continuum models (also known as care cascade models) are used by researchers and health system planners to identify potential gaps or disparities in healthcare, but these models have limited applications to complex or chronic clinical conditions. Cyclical continuum models that integrate more complex clinical information and that are displayed using circular data visualization tools may help to overcome these limitations. We performed proof-of-concept cyclical continuum modeling for one such group of conditions-musculoskeletal infections-and assessed for racial and ethnic disparities across the complex care process related to these infections.','Cyclical continuum modeling was performed in a diverse, retrospective cohort of 1648 patients with musculoskeletal infections, including osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and/or infectious myositis, in the University of New Mexico Health System. Logistic regression was used to estimate the relative odds of each element or outcome of care in the continuum. Results were visualized using circularized, map-like images depicting the continuum of care.','Racial and ethnic disparities differed at various phases in the care process. Hispanic/Latinx patients had evidence of healthcare disparities across the continuum, including diabetes mellitus [odds ratio (OR) 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61, 2.60 compared to a white non-Hispanic reference category]; osteomyelitis (OR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.63); and amputation (OR 1.48; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.00). Native American patients had evidence of disparities early in the continuum (diabetes mellitus OR 3.59, 95% CI: 2.63, 4.89; peripheral vascular disease OR 2.50; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.30; osteomyelitis OR 1.43; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.95) yet lower odds of later-stage complications (amputation OR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.69, 1.52). African American/Black non-Hispanic patients had higher odds of primary risk factors (diabetes mellitus OR 2.70; 95% CI: 1.41, 5.19; peripheral vascular disease OR 4.96; 95% CI: 2.06, 11.94) and later-stage outcomes (amputation OR 2.74; 95% CI: 1.38, 5.45) but not intervening, secondary risk factors (osteomyelitis OR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.48).','By identifying different structural and clinical barriers to care that may be experienced by groups of patients interacting with the healthcare system, cyclical continuum modeling may be useful for the study of healthcare disparities."
"Quantitative health disparities research has increasingly employed intersectionality as a theoretical tool to investigate how social characteristics intersect to generate health inequality. Yet, intersectionality was not designed to quantify, predict, or identify health disparities, and, as a result, multiple criticisms against its misapplication in health disparities research have been made. As such, there is an emerging need to evaluate the growing body of quantitative research that aims to investigate health disparities through an intersectional lens.','We conducted a systematic review from earliest records to January 2020 to (i) describe the scope of limitations when applying intersectionality to quantitative health disparities research, and (ii) identify recommendations to improve the future integration of intersectionality with this scholarship. We identified relevant publications with electronic searches in PubMed and CA Web of Science. Studies eligible for inclusion were English-language publications that used quantitative methodologies to investigate health disparities among adults in the U.S. while explicitly claiming to adopt an intersectional perspective. Out of 1279 articles reviewed, 65 were eligible for inclusion.','Our review found that, while the value of intersectionality to the study of health disparities is evident, the existing research struggles with meeting intersectionality's fundamental assumptions. In particular, four limitations were found to be widespread: narrowing the measurements of intersectionality, intersectional groups, and health outcomes; placing primacy on the study of certain intersectional groups to the neglect of others; overlooking underlying explanatory mechanisms that contribute to the health disparities experienced by intersectional groups; and, lacking in the use of life-course perspectives to show how health disparities vary across different life stages.','If the goal of health equality is to be achieved among diverse intersectional groups, future research must be assisted by the collection and examination of data that overcomes these limitations."
"Despite remarkable achievements in ensuring health equity, racial/ethnic disparities in sleep still persist and are emerging as a major area of concern. Accumulating evidence has not yet been well characterized from a broad perspective.

Studies that met inclusion criteria were retrieved and organized in a data charting form by study design, sleep measuring methods, sleep features, and racial/ethnic comparisons.','One hundred sixteen studies were included in this review. Most studies focused on disparities between Whites and Blacks. Disproportionately fewer studies examined disparities for Hispanic, Asian, and other racial/ethnic groups. Self-reported sleep was most frequently used. Sleep duration, overall sleep quality, and sleep disordered breathing were frequently studied, whereas other features including sleep efficiency, latency, continuity, and architecture were understudied, particularly in racial minority groups in the US. Current study findings on racial/ethnic disparities in most of sleep features is mixed and inconclusive.','This review identified significant evidence gaps in racial/ethnic disparities research on sleep. Our results suggest a need for more studies examining diverse sleep features using standardized and robust measuring methods for more valid comparisons of sleep health in diverse race/ethnicity groups."
"Health disparities are health differences linked with economic, social, and environmental disadvantage. They adversely affect groups that have systematically experienced greater social or economic obstacles to health. Renewed efforts are needed to reduced health disparities in the United States, highlighted by the disparate impact on racial minorities during the coronavirus pandemic. Institutional or systemic patterns of racism are promoted and legitimated through accepted societal standards, and organizational processes within the field of medicine, and contribute to health disparities. Herein, we review current evidence regarding health disparities in allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, drug allergy, and primary immune deficiency disease in racial and ethnic underserved populations. Best practices to address these disparities involve addressing social determinants of health and adopting policies to improve access to specialty care and treatment for the underserved through telemedicine and community partnerships, cross-cultural provider training to reduce implicit bias, inclusion of underserved patients in research, implementation of culturally competent patient education, and recruitment and training of health care providers from underserved communities. Addressing health disparities requires a multilevel approach involving patients, health providers, local agencies, professional societies, and national governmental agencies."

"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Recent studies highlight racial-ethnic disparities in insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but drivers of disparities remain poorly understood beyond socioeconomic status (SES). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We recruited a diverse sample of young adults (YA) with T1D from six diabetes centers across the United States, enrolling equal numbers of non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, and Hispanic YA. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine to what extent SES, demographics, health care factors (care setting, clinic attendance), and diabetes self-management (diabetes numeracy, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and Self-Care Inventory score) explained insulin pump and CGM use in each racial-ethnic group. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We recruited 300 YA with T1D, aged 18-28 years. Fifty-two percent were publicly insured, and the mean hemoglobin A1c was 9.5%. Large racial-ethnic disparities in insulin pump and CGM use existed: 72% and 71% for NH White, 40% and 37% for Hispanic, and 18% and 28% for NH Black, respectively. After multiple adjustment, insulin pump and CGM use remained disparate: 61% and 53% for NH White, 49% and 58% for Hispanic, and 20 and 31% for NH Black, respectively. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Insulin pump and CGM use was the lowest in NH Black, intermediate in Hispanic, and highest in NH White YA with T1D. SES was not the sole driver of disparities nor did additional demographic, health care, or diabetes-specific factors fully explain disparities, especially between NH Black and White YA. Future work should examine how minority YA preferences, provider implicit bias, systemic racism, and mistrust of medical systems help to explain disparities in diabetes technology use."
"<b>Rationale:</b> Black adults have worse health outcomes compared with white adults in certain chronic diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<b>Objectives:</b> To determine to what degree disadvantage by individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) may contribute to racial disparities in COPD outcomes.<b>Methods:</b> Individual and neighborhood-scale sociodemographic characteristics were determined in 2,649 current or former adult smokers with and without COPD at recruitment into SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study). We assessed whether racial differences in symptom, functional, and imaging outcomes (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test score, modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, 6-minute-walk test distance, and computed tomography [CT] scan metrics) and severe exacerbation risk were explained by individual or neighborhood SES. Using generalized linear mixed model regression, we compared respiratory outcomes by race, adjusting for confounders and individual-level and neighborhood-level descriptors of SES both separately and sequentially.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> After adjusting for COPD risk factors, Black participants had significantly worse respiratory symptoms and quality of life (modified Medical Research Council scale, COPD Assessment Test, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire), higher risk of severe exacerbations and higher percentage of emphysema, thicker airways (internal perimeter of 10 mm), and more air trapping on CT metrics compared with white participants. In addition, the association between Black race and respiratory outcomes was attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjusting for individual-level SES, which explained up to 12-35% of racial disparities. Further adjustment showed that neighborhood-level SES explained another 26-54% of the racial disparities in respiratory outcomes. Even after accounting for both individual and neighborhood SES factors, Black individuals continued to have increased severe exacerbation risk and persistently worse CT outcomes (emphysema, air trapping, and airway wall thickness).<b>Conclusions:</b> Disadvantages by individual- and neighborhood-level SES each partly explain disparities in respiratory outcomes between Black individuals and white individuals. Strategies to narrow the gap in SES disadvantages may help to reduce race-related health disparities in COPD; however, further work is needed to identify additional risk factors contributing to persistent disparities."

All the studies used retrospective data, with 70 % involving national database studies, 41 assessing the impact of race/ethnicity, 22 assessing the impact of socioeconomic status, 18 assessing the impact of insurance status, 23 assessing the impact of gender, 26 assessing the impact of age, and 3 assessing the impact of location on the delivery of cancer-directed therapies. Race, socioeconomic status, insurance status, gender, and age- based disparities in receipt of surgical resection, treatment at high-volume facilities and multimodal therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer, receipt of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic cancer, and receipt of expected standard-of-care treatment are reported.','Significant sociodemographic disparities in access to equitable oncologic care exist along the continuum of pancreatic cancer care. Multiple patient, provider, and systemic factors contribute to these disparities. The ongoing study of these disparities is important to elucidate processes that may be targeted to improve access to equitable oncologic care for patients with pancreatic cancer."
"Health disparities among racial and ethnic and socioeconomic groups are pervasive, and the COVID-19 pandemic has not been an exception. This study explores the key demographic and socioeconomic factors related to racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage.','Using recent (January 2021-March 2021) data on adults from the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, a regression-based decomposition method was used to estimate how much of the observed racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage could be explained by particular socioeconomic and demographic factors (i.e., age, number of children and adults in household).','Demographics, socioeconomic factors, and experiencing economic hardship during the pandemic each explained a statistically significant portion of vaccination coverage disparities between non-Hispanic White and racial/ethnic minority individuals. The largest disparity was observed among people who identified as Hispanic or Latino, whose vaccination coverage was 8.0 (95% CI=7.1, 8.9) percentage points lower than that of their non-Hispanic White counterparts. Socioeconomic factors explained 4.8 (95% CI=4.3, 5.2) percentage points of this disparity, and economic hardship explained an additional 1.4 (95% CI=1.2, 1.6) percentage points.','This paper identified the key factors related to racial and ethnic disparities in adult vaccination coverage. The variables that explained the largest portions of the disparities were age, education, employment, and income. The study findings can help to inform efforts to increase equitable vaccine access and engage various segments of the population to prevent the further exacerbation of COVID-19 health disparities."
"Untreated dental caries (UC), although preventable, is the most prevalent disease in the United States. UC diminishes quality of life and lowers productivity for millions of Americans and is notably higher among lower-income compared to higher-income persons.','This study examines changes in disparities by income in past-year dental use (DU) and UC in 4 life stages (2<b>-</b>5, 6<b>-</b>19, 20<b>-</b>64, and ≥65 y) between 1999<b>-</b>2004 and 2011<b>-</b>2016. We also examined changes in dental safety net policies during this time.','We obtained data on dependent variables, UC and DU, from cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys for 1999<b>-</b>2004 and 2011<b>-</b>2016. We used multivariable regression models with 3 main-effect explanatory variables: income (<200% or ≥200% federal poverty level), life stage, and survey period (1999<b>-</b>2004 or 2011<b>-</b>2016) and sociodemographic variables. We included 2-way interaction terms among main-effect variables to test whether disparities had changed over time in each life stage and a 3-way term to test changes in disparities differed across life stages.','Model-adjusted disparities in DU decreased for both preschool-age and school-age children, and disparities in UC decreased for school-age children. Changes in DU and UC disparities were not detectable for working-age adults and increased for retirement-age adults. Changes in DU and UC among preschool and school-age children were not significantly different from one another and were significantly different from changes among retirement-age adults. Compared to working-age adults, changes in disparities for DU and UC were significantly different for school-age children, and changes in DU were significantly different for preschool-age children. Between surveys, the dental safety net was expanded for youth but remained largely unchanged for adults.','Expanding the dental safety net for youth could have contributed to increased access to dental care among children relative to adults and contributed to the decrease in disparities in DU and UC among youth.','Between 1999<b>-</b>2004 and 2011<b>-</b>2016, the dental safety net was expanded for youth but remained largely unchanged for adults. Using national survey data to compare changes in disparities in past-year dental use and untreated dental caries by income between adults and youth sheds light on the potential impact of expanding the dental safety net."
"Recent studies have observed that racial or ethnic adult health disparities revealed in national data dissipate in racially integrated communities, supporting the theory that ""place, not race"" shapes the nature and magnitude of racial/ethnic health disparities. This study tested this theory among children.','In 2020, the racial/ethnic childhood obesity disparities within integrated schools and between segregated schools were estimated using statewide cross-sectional data collected in 2019 on fifth, seventh, and ninth grade students from California public schools.','School segregation accounted for a large part of the obesity disparities between White children and children of color (Latino, Black, and Filipino children). In racially integrated schools, obesity disparities were much smaller than those in statewide data, whereas racial or ethnic childhood obesity disparities were larger when comparing children in majority-White schools with those attending schools with a majority enrollment of children of color, except for Asian children, who generally had lower obesity rates than their White peers.','School-level racial segregation is a salient contributor to racial/ethnic childhood obesity disparities. Reducing obesity disparities may be particularly effective if place-level interventions target socioeconomically disadvantaged integrated schools and segregated schools attended primarily by children of color."
"A growing literature has pointed out disparities in teleworking among different racial and ethnic (hereafter racial) workers. This study estimated racial disparities in teleworking due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which these disparities were mediated by four-year college education and occupation in the United States. The data source for this study was the Current Population Survey, May 2020 through July 2021. The results showed that in the reduced model, the odds for Black and Hispanic workers to telework were 35% and 55% lower, respectively, and for Asian workers 44% higher than for White workers, controlling for covariates. When four-year college education and occupation were included as mediator variables in the model, the odds for Black and Hispanic workers to telework were reduced to 7% and 16%, respectively. Overall, disparities in four-year college education and occupation explained 83% and 78% of the variation in the odds of teleworking for Black and Hispanic workers, respectively. Between the mediators, occupation explained more than 60% of the total effect. The results of this study could not rule out the possibility of racial discrimination in teleworking. Ultimately, reducing racial disparities in four-year college education and in different occupations might be a long-term solution for reducing racial disparities in teleworking."
"A wide range of studies have revealed racial/ethnic and gender disparities in child protection decision-making.','This study investigated whether disparities are mediated by stereotypes that professionals may hold, by applying the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) which suggests that stereotypes are formed by perceptions of sociability, morality, and competence.','258 professionals (133 current staff and 125 trainees) from Colorado participated in the study.','The study applied a 2 × 3 randomized experimental vignette design. Participants read a case in which the gender of the parent responsible for maltreatment (mother or father) and race/ethnicity of the family (white, Black, or Latinx) varied.','A SEM model (CFI = .94, RMSEA = .05) with free parameters for trainees and current staff was estimated. No significant association between stereotypes and race/ethnicity and gender appeared. However, evidence for disparities emerged. In the trainee group, scores to decide for a supervision order were higher for white fathers, Black mothers, Latinx mothers, and Latinx fathers (β = 0.18 to 0.25) compared to white mothers. Current staff provided larger risk scores for Black mothers and both Latinx parents (β = 0.20 to 0.22) compared to the white mother, resulting in increased inclinations to decide for a supervision order (β = 0.26). Lastly, negative perceptions of morality increased supervision order scores (β = -0.55 to -0.36).','Evidence for disparities in decision-making appeared, but the study could not confirm that these disparities were mediated by stereotypes. Furthermore, perceptions of morality seemed to impact decision-making processes."
"Resources to prepare Allergy and Immunology trainees and providers to recognize and address health disparities are lacking. We designed a curriculum using interactive sessions incorporating disease-specific, evidence-based content, and a panel-based workshop with facilitated discussion to prepare Allergy and Immunology trainees to identify structural racism and health disparities. Pre-session surveys revealed that a high portion of trainees reported feeling comfortable recognizing bias and discussing health equity (n = 16, mean = 3.6/5 on a Likert scale), but felt less confident in their ability to address disparities in practice or to identify resources to care for historically disadvantaged communities (n = 16, mean = 2.9/5 on a Likert scale). The curriculum improved respondents' confidence in their ability to address these issues, with a panel-based workshop increasing attendees' scores an average of 0.65 points (n = 17, mean: pre-survey 3.31 vs post-survey 3.95). After the sessions, a toolkit was created to optimize delivery of medical education to address health disparities and define core concepts for this subject. Resources to implement these concepts in research design and recruitment efforts were included. With inadequate guidance for the incorporation of disparities-focused medical education curricula, our educational series, resources, and interactive toolkit add to existing literature to improve disparities competencies in teaching, clinical practices, and research design."
"Disparities in pancreatic cancer incidence and outcomes exist in Native American populations. These disparities are multifactorial, difficult to quantify, and are influenced by historical, socioeconomic, and health care structural factors. The objective of this article was to assess these factors and offer a call to action to overcome them. The authors reviewed published data on pancreatic cancer in Native American populations with a focus on disparities in incidence, outcomes, and research efforts. The historical context of the interactions between Native Americans and the United States health care system was also analyzed to form actionable items to build trust and collaboration. The incidence of pancreatic cancer in Native Americans is higher than that in the general US population and has the worst survival of any major racial or ethnic group. These outcomes are influenced by a patient population with often poor access to high-quality cancer care, historical trauma potentially leading to reduced care utilization, and a lack of research focused on etiologies and comorbid conditions that contribute to these disparities. A collaborative effort between nontribal and tribal leaders and cancer centers is key to addressing disparities in pancreatic cancer outcomes and research. More population-level studies are needed to better understand the incidence, etiologies, and comorbid conditions of pancreatic cancer in Native Americans. Finally, a concerted, focused effort should be undertaken between nontribal and tribal entities to increase the access of Native Americans to high-quality care for pancreatic cancer and other lethal malignancies."
"The NIMHD Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers for Health Disparities Research Focused on Precision Medicine (PM TCCs) comprise regional coalitions of research institutions and consortium partners focused on priority research topics in minority health and health disparities. In April 2016, NIMHD, in partnership with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), launched the PM TCC program to fund five centers across the United States to stimulate health disparities research with an emphasis on precision medicine to address one or more documented health disparities. The programs draw on expertise in genomics and other 'omics, physiology and medicine, population health disparities, behavioral and social sciences, and the science of translation, implementation and dissemination. The TCC program's overarching goal is to develop and disseminate effective interventions that can be implemented in real-world settings with the goal of promoting health equity and reducing health disparities. This special issue of <i>Ethnicity & Disease</i> is dedicated to cutting-edge research conducted by the five PM TCCs at the intersection between precision medicine and health disparities. Articles in this issue will enhance knowledge in a variety of research topics from perspectives on precision medicine among different health disparity populations to methods for reducing inequities in protocols, interventions, and health information and further efforts to promote inclusion of all populations, especially the most vulnerable."
"The aim of this study was to assess racial disparities in treatments and outcomes between Non-Hispanic black (NHB), Hispanic and Non-Hispanic white (NHW) children with type 1 diabetes (T1D).','We reviewed electronic health records of children (<18 years) attending a large, pediatric tertiary care diabetes center in the United States between October 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. Health care utilization (appointment attendance, ED visits, hospitalizations), technology use (insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors [CGM]) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were examined for each race/ethnicity and stratified by insurance type (private/government) as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES).','Of 1331 children (47% female) with a median (IQR) age of 14.2 (11.5, 16.3) years and T1D duration of 5.8 (3.8, 9) years; 1026 (77%) were NHW, 198 (15%) NHB, and 107 (8%) Hispanic. Government insurance was used by 358 (27%) children, representing 60% of NHB and 53% of Hispanic, but only 18% of NHW children. NHB children had higher HbA1c, more ED visits and hospitalizations, and were less likely to be treated with insulin pumps or CGM than NHW children (P < .001 for all). There were no racial disparities with regard to the number of appointments attended.','Racial disparities in technology use and diabetes outcomes persist in children with T1D, regardless of insurance status. To ensure equitable care, pediatric healthcare providers should remain cognizant of racial disparities in diabetes treatment. The impact of provider and patient factors should be explored when studying the etiology of these health disparities."
"Disparities in sleep health are important but underrecognized contributors to health disparities. Understanding the factors contributing to sleep heath disparities and developing effective interventions are critical to improving all aspects of heath. Sleep heath disparities are impacted by socioeconomic status, racism, discrimination, neighborhood segregation, geography, social patterns, and access to health care as well as by cultural beliefs, necessitating a cultural appropriateness component in any intervention devised for reducing sleep health disparities. Pediatric sleep disparities require innovative and urgent intervention to establish a foundation of lifelong healthy sleep. Tapping the vast potential of technology in improving sleep health access may be an underutilized tool to reduce sleep heath disparities. Identifying, implementing, replicating, and disseminating successful interventions to address sleep disparities have the potential to reduce overall disparities in health and quality of life."
"In the United States, educational disparities in disability are large and increasing, but the mechanisms underlying them are not well understood. We estimate the proportion of population-level educational disparities in disability incidence explained by excess body mass index (BMI), smoking, and manual labor.','We use waves 2003-2015 of the nationally representative Panel Study of Income Dynamics to calculate observed disability incidence and counterfactual incidence absent the key mediators (3,129 individuals; 13,168 observations). We take advantage of earlier-life measures, including childhood socioeconomic status, 1986 BMI, and occupational history between 1968 and 2001. To account for distinct processes in women and men at middle versus older ages, we stratify by gender and at age 65.','Educational disparities in disability incidence were evident in women and men at younger and older ages, and were largest among older women. Together, the mediators of interest were estimated to explain roughly 60% of disparities in younger women, 65%-70% in younger men, 40% in older women, and 20%-60% in older men. The main contributors to disparities appeared to be excess BMI and smoking in younger women; manual labor and smoking in younger men; excess BMI in older women; and smoking in older men.','These mediators explain much of disparities in earlier-age disability; successful interventions to address these factors may substantially reduce them. However, a considerable proportion of disparities remained unexplained, particularly at older ages, reflecting the myriad pathways by which educational attainment can influence disability status."
"There is a long history of racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare and they continue to persist in contemporary society. These disparities have the potential to negatively affect morbidity and mortality in racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. Diagnosis, medical treatment, and rehabilitation for laryngeal cancer have improved considerably, leading to improvements in overall survival rates and physical, social, and psychological functioning. Yet members of minority and underrepresented groups are at an increased risk for experiencing reduced access to quality care and delays between diagnosis and treatment, and as a result have lower survival rates. Increasing health providers' awareness of racial and ethnic disparities in laryngeal cancer is necessary to facilitate changes in patient and provider education, clinical practice, and health policies. The purpose of this review is to summarize current literature on disparities in laryngeal cancer diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation among Black and Hispanic patients. We present recent data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to examine trends in laryngeal cancer and patient, provider, and health systems factors that may perpetuate these disparities. In addition, we offer interventions to address racism and other racial and ethnic biases in laryngeal cancer care and describe research and legislative actions that are needed to reduce disparities in this area."
"Adult vaccination coverage remains low in the United States, particularly among racial and ethnic minority populations.','To conduct a comprehensive literature review of research studies assessing racial and ethnic disparities in adult vaccination.','We conducted a search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant articles.','Research studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (1) study based in the United States, (2) evaluated receipt of routine immunizations in adult populations, (3) used within-study comparison of race/ethnic groups, and (4) eligible for at least one author-defined PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome) question.','Preliminary abstract review was conducted by two authors. Following complete abstraction of articles using a standardized template, abstraction notes and determinations were reviewed by all authors; disagreements regarding article inclusion/exclusion were resolved by majority rule. The Social Ecological Model framework was used to complete a narrative review of observational studies to summarize factors associated with disparities; a systematic review was used to evaluate eligible intervention studies.','Ninety-five studies were included in the final analysis and summarized qualitatively within two main topic areas: (1) factors associated with documented racial-ethnic disparities in adult vaccination and (2) interventions aimed to reduce disparities or to improve vaccination coverage among racial-ethnic minority groups. Of the 12 included intervention studies, only 3 studies provided direct evidence and were of Level II, fair quality; the remaining 9 studies met the criteria for indirect evidence (Level I or II, fair or poor quality).','A considerable amount of observational research evaluating factors associated with racial and ethnic disparities in adult vaccination is available. However, intervention studies aimed at reducing these disparities are limited, are of poor quality, and insufficiently address known reasons for low vaccination uptake among racial and ethnic minority adults."
"To summarize existing literature on neonatal disparities in congenital heart disease surgical outcomes and identify potential policies to address these disparities.','Disparities in outcomes for neonatal congenital heart surgery were largely published under four domains: race/ethnicity, insurance type, neighborhood/socioeconomic status, and cardiac center characteristics. While existing research identifies associations between these domains and mortality, more nuanced analyses are emerging to understand the mediators between these domains and other non-mortality outcomes, as well as potential interventions and policies to reduce disparities. A broader look into social determinants of health (SDOH), prenatal diagnosis, proximity of birth to a cardiac surgical center, and post-surgical outpatient and neurodevelopmental follow-up may accelerate interventions to mitigate disparities in outcomes.','Understanding the mechanisms of how SDOH relate to neonatal surgical outcomes is paramount, as disparities research in neonatal congenital heart surgery continues to shift from identification and description, to intervention and policy."
"We propose the Disparities in ART (DART) hypothesis which identifies underlining causes that contribute to racial disparities in access and outcomes of ART treatment in the USA. Reasons for disparities in access and outcomes of ART treatment for infertility are derived from some relative contribution of four identified causes. They are simply stated as delays in obtaining treatment, higher dropout during and following unsuccessful ART treatment, provider factors, and differences in patient biological factors. Each of these causes has a subset of 4-6 factors that contribute to each of the 4 broad categorical causes that are discussed. This hypothesis may serve as a platform for better understanding the scope of the challenges and potential research inquiries that may lead to narrowing of racial/ethnic disparities in access and outcomes in ART."
"A need exists to examine racial disparities in the healthcare arena and the impact on patients with cancer. Despite ongoing efforts to increase equity in primary healthcare access, racial and socioeconomic disparities persist, thus contributing to disproportionate treatment outcomes and survivorship among minority and low-income patients. Such disparities have been revealed in treatment cohorts of patients with multiple forms of cancer, including breast, cervical, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, lung, colorectal, gastrointestinal, and hepatocellular, and have been attributed to a range of co-occurring behavioral, social determinants of health, underlying genetic factors, as well as access to educational opportunities that limit the quality of informed healthcare. These various interrelated factors widen cancer healthcare disparities synergistically throughout underserved communities, and their influence has been amplified by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Fundamentally, a lack of basic and clinical research exists that fails to adequately reflect diversity and minority involvement in drug development. Although overcoming the obstacles responsible for chronic treatment disparities is a formidable task, promising means of achieving more uniform quality healthcare are becoming more clearly elucidated. To reduce disease progression, increase overall survival, and improve the health of vulnerable populations, it is necessary to identify and fully disclose environmental, biological, and ancestral factors that impact the risk for cancer; heal historical fractures within communities; and increase participation of racial and ethnic minorities in screening efforts and research studies. This requires developing a system of justice and trust based on specific, solution-oriented grassroots community efforts working in tandem with medical and pharmaceutical leaders. By fully exploring and pinpointing the underlying causes of healthcare disparities, it should be possible to define strategies and interventions most likely to transform cancer care. The ultimate goal is understanding individual, cultural, and biological vulnerabilities, including environmental and epigenetic liabilities, to optimize cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment."
"Exclusive breastmilk feeding during the delivery hospitalization, a Joint Commission indicator of perinatal care quality, is associated with longer-term breastfeeding success. Marked racial and ethnic disparities in breastfeeding exclusivity and duration existed prior to COVID-19. The pandemic, accompanied by uncertainty regarding intrapartum and postpartum safety practices, may have influenced disparities in infant feeding practices. Our objective was to examine whether the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City was associated with a change in racial and ethnic disparities in exclusive breastmilk feeding during the delivery stay.','We conducted a cross-sectional study of electronic medical records from 14,964 births in two New York City hospitals. We conducted a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis to compare Black-white, Latina-white, and Asian-white disparities in exclusive breastmilk feeding in a pandemic cohort (April 1-July 31, 2020, n=3122 deliveries) to disparities in a pre-pandemic cohort (January 1, 2019-February 28, 2020, n=11,842). We defined exclusive breastmilk feeding as receipt of only breastmilk during delivery hospitalization, regardless of route of administration. We ascertained severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection status from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests from nasopharyngeal swab at admission. For each DID model (e.g. Black-white disparity), we used covariate-adjusted log binomial regression models to estimate racial and ethnic risk differences, pandemic versus pre-pandemic cohort risk differences, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator.','Exclusive breastmilk feeding increased from pre-pandemic to pandemic among white (40.8% to 46.6%, p<0.001) and Asian (27.9% to 35.8%, p=0.004) women, but not Black (22.6% to 25.3%, p=0.275) or Latina (20.1% to 21.4%, p=0.515) women overall. There was an increase in the Latina-white exclusive breastmilk feeding disparity associated with the pandemic (DID estimator=6.3 fewer cases per 100 births (95% CI=-10.8, -1.9)). We found decreased breastmilk feeding specifically among SARS-CoV-2 positive Latina women (20.1% pre-pandemic vs. 9.1% pandemic p=0.013), and no change in Black-white or Asian-white disparities.','We observed a pandemic-related increase in the Latina-white disparity in exclusive breastmilk feeding, urging hospital policies and programs to increase equity in breastmilk feeding and perinatal care quality during and beyond this health emergency."
"To disrupt conflations between 'health disparities research' and critical engagement with racism, whiteness, other oppressions and our profession's ongoing roles in white supremacy.','In Oncology Nursing Society's (ONS) 2019-2023 research agenda, health disparities are highlighted as a top priority for nursing knowledge generation and intervention. The document concludes needs for increased 'minority and vulnerable population' participation in cancer clinical trials, reduced financial toxicity, behavioural interventions for risk reduction, incorporation of social determinants of health and technology to promote rural access to high-quality care.','In this critical resistive, theoretical and ethical analysis on current discourses on health disparities research in oncology nursing, we ask: (a) What forces (stated and unstated) shape current oncology nursing discourses about health disparities?; (b) What assumptions about health and power are embedded in these discourses?; (c) Are we, as nurses and scientists, asking the right questions?','Line-by-line analysis of the ONS Research Agenda for 2019-2023 'Health Disparities' section.','The health disparities described in this report are not new to the literature, nor are many of the proposed solutions. As noted, disparities such as disproportionate cancer-related morbidity and mortality across identities (gender, race and sexual orientation) have not improved and some have worsened over several decades.','That discourses on prioritising cancer-related health disparities persist while disparity-related outcomes remain largely unchanged presents challenges-both moral and pragmatic. We must ask, 'Rather than the concept of ""health disparities,"" as presently understood in cancer nursing, what is the better approach to examine health equity and ethical nursing research practices?'','This paper offers several starting places for nurses, especially with the following questions: 'Who does this harm?' Answer then revise: 'Who might this harm now?' Answer then revise: 'Are these harms worth the activity?' And repeat this process."
"To address the high burden of diabetes, China has managed to strengthen diabetes care during the past decade. This study aimed to examine trends and disparities in the coverage of diabetes care among diabetes patients aged 45 years and older following China's healthcare reform. We used data from the 2011-12 baseline survey and 2015-16 follow-up survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The prevalence of three diabetes care indicators were compared between the two periods and by participants' characteristics. Logistic regressions and random-effect logit model were used to investigate the socioeconomic and geographic disparities in diabetes care indicators and assess whether there was a significant improvement in these disparities from 2011-12 to 2015-16. We found the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 45 years and above increased from 16.37% in 2011-12 to 20.33% in 2015-16 in China. Between the 2011-12 and 2015-16 surveys, the proportions of diabetes patients who received health education increased from 31.68% to 35.63%, diabetes-related examination from 32.21% to 41.32%, and diabetes treatment from 30.8% to 36.6%. Disparities in the coverage of diabetes care still existed; while geographic disparities improved significantly during the study period, individual socioeconomic disparities persisted. To address disparities in diabetes care, more effort needs to be directed to improve the primary care system to ensure the quality and timely delivery of diabetes care. Tailored programs should be carried out with more attention given to underserved groups with less educational attainment and lower economic status."
"There are stark inequities in stroke incidence, prevalence, acute care, rehabilitation, risk factor control, and outcomes. To address these inequities, it is critical to engage communities in identifying priorities and designing, implementing, and disseminating interventions. This issue of <i>Stroke</i> features health equity themed lectures delivered during the International Stroke Conference and Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-Solving meetings in 2021 as well as articles covering issues of disparities and diversity in stroke. Bruce Ovbiagele, MD, MSc, MAS, MBA, MLS, received the 2021 William Feinberg Award Lecture for his lifetime achievements in seeking global and local solutions to cerebrovascular health inequities. The second annual Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-Solving symposium, which took place the day before the International Stroke Conference in February 2021, focused on community-engaged research for reducing inequities in stroke. Phil Gorelick, MD was awarded the Edgar J. Kenton III Award for his lifetime achievements in using community engagement strategies to recruit and retain Black participants in observational studies and clinical trials. Walter Koroshetz, MD, Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke delivered the keynote lecture on stroke inequities and Richard Benson, MD, PhD, Director of the Office of Global Health and Health Disparities at National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, gave a lecture focused on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke efforts to address inequities. Nichols et al highlighted approaches of community-based participatory research to address stroke inequities. Verma et al showcased digital health innovations to reduce inequities in stroke. Das et al showed that the proportion of underrepresented in medicine vascular neurology fellows has lowered over the past decade and authors provided a road map for enhancing the diversity in vascular neurology. Clearly, to overcome inequities, multipronged strategies are required, from broadening representation among vascular neurology faculty to partnering with communities to conduct research with meaningful impact."
"The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected some communities and populations more than others. We propose that an interdisciplinary framework of 'One Health Disparities' advances understanding of the social and systemic issues that drive COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. One Health Disparities integrates the social environment with One Health perspectives on the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. To apply this framework, we consider One Health Disparities that emerge in three key components of disease transmission: exposure, susceptibility, and disease expression. Exposure disparities arise through variation in contact with COVID-19's causative agent, SARS-CoV-2. Disparities in susceptibility and disease expression also exist; these are driven by biological and social factors, such as diabetes and obesity, and through variation in access to healthcare. We close by considering how One Health Disparities informs understanding of spillback into new animal reservoirs, and what this might mean for further human health disparities.','One Health focuses on interconnections between human, animal, and environmental health. We propose that social environments are also important to One Health and help illuminate disparities in the coronavirus pandemic, including its origins, transmission and susceptibility among humans, and spillback to other species. We call this framework One Health Disparities."
"Evidence of health disparities affecting newborns abounds. Although quality improvement (QI) methodology is often suggested as a tool to advance health equity, the impact of QI initiatives on disparities is variable. QI work may mitigate, worsen, or perpetuate existing disparities. QI projects designed without an intentional focus on equity promotion may foster intervention-generated inequalities that further disadvantage vulnerable groups. This article reviews disparities in perinatal and neonatal care, the impact of QI on health disparities, and the concept of ""Equity-Focused Quality Improvement"" (EF-QI). EF-QI differs from QI with an equity lens in that it is action-oriented and centered around equity. EF-QI initiatives purposely integrate equity throughout the fabric of the project and are inclusive, collaborative efforts that foreground and address the needs of disadvantaged populations. EF-QI principles are applicable at every stage of project conception, execution, analysis, and dissemination, and may provide opportunities for reducing disparities in neonatal care."
"Despite remarkable progress, tobacco control efforts are not equitably distributed, and tobacco-related disparities continue to contribute to significant health disparities. Our premise in this commentary is that Intersectionality can serve as a productive analytical framework for examining tobacco-related disparities across and within multiple marginalized populations. Intersectionality is a theoretical framework for understanding the multiple interlocking societal systems that bestow privilege and oppression and is increasingly being to the study of health inequities. We present a model and describe how tobacco-related disparities can be understood via critical elements of Intersectionality. We conclude that the application of Intersectionality to understanding tobacco-related disparities has potential to stimulate meaningful discussion and lead to new and innovative multilevel and cross-cutting interventions to eliminate tobacco-related disparities and foster culturally safe environment in which all people can thrive.','This commentary describes how Intersectionality can serve as a productive analytic framework for examining the development and maintenance of tobacco-related disparities across and within many marginalized groups."
"Health and health care disparities in pediatric rheumatology are prevalent among socially disadvantaged and marginalized populations based on race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and geographic region. These groups are more likely to experience greater disease severity, morbidity, mortality, decreased quality of life, and poor mental health outcomes, which are in part due to persistent structural and institutional barriers, including decreased access to quality health care. Most of the research on health and health care disparities in pediatric rheumatology focuses on juvenile idiopathic arthritis and childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus; there are significant gaps in the literature assessing disparities associated with other pediatric rheumatic diseases. Understanding the underlying causes of health care disparities will ultimately inform the development and implementation of innovative policies and interventions on a federal, local, and individual level."
"Transgender adolescents use vape products (eg, e-cigarettes) at higher rates than cisgender adolescents. Little is known about how these disparities differ from the intersectional perspective of both gender identity and race/ethnicity.','We examined disparities in past 30-day vaping frequency at the intersection of gender identity and race/ethnicity among adolescents participating in two pooled waves of the population-based California Healthy Kids Survey (N = 953 445; 2017-2019). Generalized linear mixed models included gender identity-by-race/ethnicity interactions and adjusted for potential confounders. Stratified models quantified relationships between gender identity and vaping within race/ethnicity strata and between race/ethnicity and vaping within gender identity strata.','Transgender adolescents of color were more likely to report a higher frequency of vaping than cisgender white adolescents. In models stratified by race/ethnicity, transgender adolescents evidenced greater odds of more frequent vaping than cisgender adolescents of the same race/ethnicity; disparities were greatest between transgender and cisgender Black adolescents (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 6.05, 95% CI: 4.76-7.68) and smallest between transgender and cisgender white adolescents (AOR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.06-1.35). In models stratified by gender identity, disparities were greatest between transgender Black and transgender white adolescents (AOR: 2.85, 95% CI: 2.20-3.70) and smallest between transgender multiracial and transgender white adolescents (AOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.05-1.58). Similar, though less consistent, patterns emerged for adolescents of color unsure of their gender identity relative to cisgender white adolescents.','Transgender adolescents of color may be especially vulnerable to vaping disparities. Future research should identify and intervene on causal mechanisms undergirding disparities.','Research finds that transgender adolescents use vape products at higher rates than their cisgender peers, however, little is known about how patterns of adolescent vaping may differ by both gender identity and race/ethnicity, information needed to inform culturally tailored prevention and control initiatives to decrease adolescent vaping disparities. Our analysis of data from a population-based adolescent health survey finds evidence of magnified disparities in vaping frequency among transgender adolescents of color."
"We present findings from a longitudinal investigation, the purpose of which was to compare health disparities of rural Latino older adult patients diagnosed with diabetes to their non-Latino White counterparts.','A pre-post design was implemented treating Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO) participation by Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) as an intervention, and using diabetes-related hospitalizations to measure disparities. Data for a nationwide panel of 2,683 RHCs were analyzed for a study period of eight years: 2008 - 2015. In addition, data were analyzed for a subset of 116 RHCs located in Florida, Texas, and California that participated in a Medicare ACO in one or more years of the study period.','Two broad findings resulted from this investigation. First, for both the nationwide panel of RHCs and the three-state sample of ""ACO RHCs,"" there was a decrease in the mean disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates over the eight-year study period. Second, in comparing a three-year time period after Medicare ACO implementation in 2012 to a four-year period before the implementation, a statistically significant difference in mean disparities was found for the nationwide panel.','There are a number of factors that may contribute to the decrease in diabetes-related hospitalization rates for Latinos in more recent years. Future research will identify specific contributors to reducing diabetes-related hospitalization disparities between Latinos and the general population, including the possible influence of ACO participation by RHCs.','This paper presents original research conducted using data related to rural Latino older adults. The data represent multiple states and an eight-year time period. The U.S. Latino population is growing at a rapid pace. As a group, they are at a high risk for developing diabetes, the complications of which are serious and costly to the patient and the U.S. healthcare system. With the continued growth of the Latino population, it is critical that their health disparities be monitored, and that factors that contribute to their health and well-being be identified and promoted."
"This study uses multiple measures of excess deaths to analyze racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across Georgia.','The Georgia Department of Public Health provided monthly mortality data for 2010-2020 stratified by race/ethnicity, age, county, and recorded cause of death. We first calculate crude mortality rates by health district during the time period for all groups for March through June for our historical period to identify significant time-series outliers in 2020 distinguishable from general trend variations. We then calculate the mean and standard deviation of mortality rates by age and racial subgroup to create historic confidence intervals that contextualize rates in 2020. Lastly, we use risk ratios to identify disparities in mortality between Black and White mortality rates both in the 2010-2019 period and in 2020.','Time-series analysis identified three health districts with significant increases in mortality in 2020, located in metro Atlanta and Southwest Georgia. Mortality rates decreased sharply in 2020 for children in both racial categories in all sections of the state, but rose in a majority of districts for both categories in adult and older populations. Risk ratios also increased significantly in 2020 for children and older populations, showing rising disparities in mortality during the pandemic even as crude mortality rates declined for children classified as Black.','Increased mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak disproportionately affected African-Americans, possibly due, in part, to pre-existing disparities prior to the pandemic linked to social determinants of health. The pandemic deepened these disparities, perhaps due to unequal resources to effectively shelter-in-place or access medical care. Future research may identify local factors underlying geographically heterogenous differences in mortality rates to inform future policy interventions."
"<b>Objective.</b> To determine how US and Canadian pharmacy schools include content related to health disparities and cultural competence and health literacy in curriculum as well as to review assessment practices.<b>Methods.</b> A cross-sectional survey was distributed to 143 accredited and candidate-status pharmacy programs in the United States and 10 in Canada in three phases. Statistical analysis was performed to assess inter-institutional variability and relationships between institutional characteristics and survey results.<b>Results.</b> After stratification by institutional characteristics, no significant differences were found between the 72 (50%) responding institutions in the United States and the eight (80%) in Canada. A core group of faculty typically taught health disparities and cultural competence content and/or health literacy. Health disparities and cultural competence was primarily taught in multiple courses across multiple years in the pre-APPE curriculum. While health literacy was primarily taught in multiple courses in one year in the pre-APPE curriculum in Canada (75.0%), delivery of health literacy was more varied in the United States, including in a single course (20.0%), multiple courses in one year (17.1%), and multiple courses in multiple years (48.6%). Health disparities and cultural competence and health literacy was mostly taught at the introduction or reinforcement level. Active-learning approaches were mostly used in the United States, whereas in Canada active learning was more frequently used in teaching health literacy (62.5%) than health disparities and cultural competence (37.5%). Few institutions reported providing professional preceptor development.<b>Conclusion.</b> The majority of responding pharmacy schools in the United States and Canada <u>include</u> content on health disparities and cultural competence content and health literacy to varying degrees; however, less is required and implemented within experiential programs and the co-curriculum. Opportunities remain to expand and apply information on health disparities and cultural competence content and health literacy content, particularly outside the didactic curriculum, as well as to identify barriers for integration."
"Since 2014, 32 states implemented Medicaid expansion by removing the categorical criteria for childless adults and by expanding income eligibility to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) for all non-elderly adults. Previous studies found that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion improved rates of being insured, unmet needs for care due to cost, number of physician visits, and health status among low-income adults. However, a few recent studies focused on the expansion's effect on racial/ethnic disparities and used the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) disparity approach with a limited set of access measures. This quasi-experimental study examined the effect of Medicaid expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in access to health care for U.S. citizens aged 19 to 64 with income below 138% of the federal poverty line. The difference-in-differences model compared changes over time in 2 measures of insurance coverage and 8 measures of access to health care, using National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2010 to 2016. Analyses used the NAM definition of disparities. Medicaid expansion was associated with significant decreases in uninsured rates and increases in Medicaid coverage among all racial/ethnic groups. There were differences across racial/ethnic groups regarding which specific access measures improved. For delayed care and unmet need for care, decreases in racial/ethnic disparities were observed. After the ACA Medicaid expansion, most access outcomes improved for disadvantaged groups, but also for others, with the result that disparities were not significantly reduced."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in the surgical treatment of hip fractures have been previously reported, demonstrating delayed time to surgery and worse perioperative outcomes for minority patients. However, data are lacking on how these disparities have trended over time and whether national efforts have succeeded in reducing them. The aim of this study was to investigate temporal trends in racial and ethnic disparities in perioperative metrics for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery in the United States from 2006 to 2015.','The National Inpatient Sample was queried for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients who underwent hip fracture surgery between 2006 and 2015. Perioperative metrics, including delayed time to surgery (≥2 calendar days from admission to surgical intervention), length of stay (LOS), total inpatient complications, and mortality, were trended over time. Changes in racial and ethnic disparities were assessed using linear and logistic regression models.','During the study period, there were persistent disparities in delayed time to surgery for White versus Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients (eg, White versus Black: 30.1% versus 39.7% in 2006 and 22% versus 28.8% in 2015, Ptrend> 0.05 for all). Although disparities in total LOS remained consistent for White versus Black patients (Ptrend= 0.97), these disparities improved for White versus Hispanic and Asian patients (eg, White versus Hispanic: 4.8 days versus 5.3 in 2006 and 4.1 days versus 4.4 in 2015, Ptrend < 0.05 for both).','Racial and ethnic disparities were persistent in time to surgery and discharge disposition for hip fracture surgery between White and minority patients from 2006 to 2015 in the United States. These disparities particularly affected Black patients. Although there were encouraging signs of improving disparities in the LOS, these findings highlight the need for renewed orthopaedic initiatives and healthcare reform policies aimed at reducing perioperative disparities in orthopaedic trauma care."
"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends palliative care should be integrated in to cancer care starting from cancer diagnosis. However, traditionally palliative care is prioritized for cancer patients at the end-of-life. In our main article titled ""Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Palliative Care Utilization Among Gynecological Cancer Patients"" we present data describing racial/ethnic disparities among metastatic gynecological cancer patients who were deceased at last follow-up. Here, we expand our population to evaluate racial disparities in palliative care utilization among (1) all metastatic gynecologic cancer patients, regardless of vital status (alive or deceased) (<i>n</i> = 176,899) and (2) among only patients who were alive at last follow-up (<i>n</i> = 66,781). We used data from the 2016 National Cancer Database (NCDB) and included patients between ages 18-90 years with metastatic (stage III-IV) gynecologic cancers including, ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer. Palliative care was defined by NCDB as non-curative treatment, and could include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and pain management or any combination. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate racial disparities in palliative care use among our two populations of interest. Overall, the mean age of gynecologic cancer patients utilizing palliative care was 66 years. Five percent of all metastatic gynecologic oncology patients utilized palliative care overall; and by cancer site palliative care use was as follows: 4% among ovarian, 9% among cervical, and 11% among uterine cancer patients. Among patients who utilized palliative care, 62% utilized surgery, radiation or chemotherapy only and 12% utilized pain management as a form of palliative care. Among ovarian cancer patients, Hispanic ovarian cancer patients were less likely to utilize palliative care compared to their NH-White counterparts (aOR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68-0.91). Among cervical cancer patients, we observed that Hispanic (aOR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.75) and Asian (aOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.59-0.93) were less likely to utilize palliative care than NH-White cervical cancer patients. We observed no racial disparities in palliative care utilization among uterine cancer patients. When we focused on patients who were alive at last follow-up we found that only 3% of patients utilized palliative care. We also conducted multivariable analyses of racial/ethnic disparities among ovarian and cervical cancer patients who were alive at last follow-up. We were unable to conduct multivariable analyses of uterine cancer patients who were alive at last follow-up due to limited sample size of those who utilized palliative care. We observed no racial/ethnic disparities among this patient population of metastatic gynecologic patients."
"Little is known about how the geographic variation and disparities in use of elective primary total hip and knee replacements for Medicare beneficiaries have evolved in recent years. The study objectives are to determine these variations and disparities, whether Black Medicare beneficiaries have continued to undergo fewer total hip replacements and total knee replacements across regions, and whether disparities affected all Black beneficiaries or mainly affected socioeconomically disadvantaged Black beneficiaries.','We used 2009 to 2017 Medicare enrollment and claims data to examine Hospital Referral Region (HRR)-level variation and disparities by race (non-Hispanic White and Black) and socioeconomic status (Medicare-only and dual eligibility for both Medicare and Medicaid). The outcomes were HRR-level age and sex-standardized total hip replacement and total knee replacement utilization rates for White Medicare-only beneficiaries, White dual-eligible beneficiaries, Black Medicare-only beneficiaries, and Black dual-eligible beneficiaries, and the differences in rates between these groups as a representation of disparities. The key exposure variables were race-socioeconomic group and year. We constructed multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models to estimate trends in total hip replacement and total knee replacement rates and to examine whether rates were lower in HRRs with high percentages of Black beneficiaries or dual-eligible beneficiaries.','The study included 924,844 total hip replacements and 2,075,968 total knee replacements. In 2017, the mean HRR-level total hip replacement rate was 4.64 surgical procedures per 1,000 beneficiaries, and the mean HRR-level total knee replacement rate was 9.66 surgical procedures per 1,000 beneficiaries, with a threefold variation across HRRs. In 2017, the total hip replacement rate was 32% higher for White Medicare-only beneficiaries and 48% higher for Black Medicare-only beneficiaries than in 2009 (p < 0.001). However, because the surgical rates for White and Black dual-eligible beneficiaries remained unchanged over the study period, the 2017 Medicare-only and dual-eligible disparity for White beneficiaries increased by 0.75 surgical procedures per 1,000 from 2009 (40.98% increase; p = 0.03), and the disparity for Black beneficiaries by 1.13 surgical procedures per 1,000 beneficiaries (297.37% increase; p < 0.001). The total knee replacement disparities remained unchanged. Notably, the rates for White dual-eligible beneficiaries were significantly lower than those for Black Medicare-only beneficiaries (p < 0.001 for both total hip replacements and total knee replacements), and fewer surgical procedures were conducted in HRRs with a higher density of Black or dual-eligible beneficiaries.','Although the total hip replacement use for Medicare-only beneficiaries of both races increased, disparities for White and Black dual-eligible beneficiaries (compared with their Medicare-only counterparts) are increasing. Efforts to improve equity must identify and address both racial and socioeconomic barriers and focus on regions with high concentrations of disadvantaged beneficiaries.','Although total hip replacements and total knee replacements are highly successful surgical procedures for end-stage osteoarthritis, our findings show that, as recently as 2017, Black beneficiaries and those dual eligible for Medicaid (a proxy for socioeconomic status) are less likely to undergo these surgical procedures and that there is profound geographic variation in the use of these surgical procedures. This evidence is essential for the design and implementation of disparity-reduction strategies focused on patients, providers, and geographic areas that can potentially improve the equity in joint replacement care."
"As with many other infectious and chronic conditions, the COVID-19 crisis in the United States (U.S.) reveals severe inequities in health. The objective of this study was to describe public perceptions of disparities in mortality from COVID-19 and examine correlates of those perceptions. We fielded a nationally-representative survey in late April 2020, asking participants how much they agreed with four statements describing group-level COVID-19 disparities: older people compared to younger, people with chronic health conditions compared to those without, poorer people compared to wealthier, and Black people compared to white people. We also measured personal characteristics, experience with COVID-19, and information sources. Overall agreement with age- and health condition-related disparities was high (>80%) while agreement with socioeconomic (SES) and racial disparities was lower (52%). Higher education and income were generally associated with greater agreement with disparities. Partisanship and information sources used were associated with perceptions of SES- and racial-disparities, with Democrats and those attune to national news-but not Fox cable news-more likely to perceive these disparities. As of April 2020, information about age- and health condition-related disparities in COVID-19 was well known by the U.S. public, while information about social disparities was less recognized and varied along socioeconomic and partisan lines."
"Racial disparities in health care are a well-documented phenomenon in the USA. Universal insurance has been suggested as a solution to mitigate these disparities. We examined race-based disparities in the Military Health System (MHS) by constructing and analyzing a framework of existing studies that measured disparities between direct care (care provided by military treatment facilities) and private sector care (care provided by civilian health care facilities).','We conducted a framework synthesis on 77 manuscripts published in partnership with the Comparative Effectiveness and Provider-Induced Demand Collaboration Project that use MHS electronic health record data to present an overview of racial disparities assessed for multiple treatment interventions in a nationally representative, universally insured population.','We identified 32 studies assessing racial disparities in areas of surgery, trauma, opioid prescription and usage, women's health, and others. Racial disparities were mitigated in postoperative complications, trauma care, and cancer screenings but persisted in diabetes readmissions, opioid usage, and minimally invasive women's health procedures.','Universal coverage mitigates many, but not all, racial disparities in health care. An examination of a broader range of interventions, a closer look at variation in care provided by civilian facilities, and a look at the quality of care by race provide further opportunities for research."
"Few studies have investigated air pollution exposure disparities by race/ethnicity and income across criteria air pollutants, locations, or time.','The objective of this study was to quantify exposure disparities by race/ethnicity and income throughout the contiguous United States for six criteria air pollutants, during the period 1990 to 2010.','We quantified exposure disparities among racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic (any race), non-Hispanic Asian) and by income for multiple spatial units (contiguous United States, states, urban vs. rural areas) and years (1990, 2000, 2010) for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math>), ozone (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>O</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math>), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>≤</mo><mn>2.5</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2.5</mn></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow></math>; excluding year-1990), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>≤</mo><mn>10</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow></math>), and sulfur dioxide (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>SO</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math>).

"To assess the potential epidemiological association between various possible risk factors and healthcare disparities specifically related to the access, use and/or quality of speech language pathology services for individuals with voice and upper airway disorders.','A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. Full text journal articles were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science. The reference sections of included articles were also manually screened and identified four additional studies for consideration of inclusion. Included articles specifically addressed healthcare disparities in voice and upper airway disorders related to speech pathology care. International literature was excluded. Eligible studies were reviewed and data extracted. Risk of bias of each eligible study was performed using the quality assessment tool from National Institute of Health for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies. Data from eligible studies were synthesized thematically.','A total of 1,101 resources were retrieved from the search; of these, 133 were duplicates. Titles and abstracts of 968 articles were screened, with 14 selected for full-text review. Eleven articles were considered eligible for inclusion. Voice disorders were the condition most frequently examined followed by only one article addressing upper airways disorders. There was considerable heterogeneity in the methodology and statistical analyses among the eligible papers. There was a lack of standard methodology for collecting and accurately determining patient characteristics as well as variability in measuring confounding variables and providing statistical analyses for such adjustments that may have impacted the findings. The information extracted from these articles revealed healthcare disparities related to sex/gender, age, insurance status/coverage, race/ethnicity, among others including etiology and preferred language.','This systematic review highlights the limited research on speech language pathology-specific healthcare disparities for individuals with voice and upper airway disorders. There was significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies which may have contributed to varied results between studies. There is a need for greater methodological rigor and prospectively designed studies to better characterize the impact of disparities in the access to, use of, and quality of speech pathology care for this patient population."
"The primary aim of this review was to evaluate recently published total joint arthroplasty (TJA) studies in order to accurately summarize the current concepts regarding racial and ethnic disparities in total joint arthroplasty.','Many studies found that racial and ethnic disparities in TJA are present in all phases of arthroplasty care including access to, utilization of, and postoperative outcomes after TJA. Factors that limit patient access to TJA-increased patient comorbidities, lower socioeconomic status, and Medicaid/uninsured status-are also disproportionately associated with underrepresented patient populations. Minority patients are more likely to require more intensive postoperative rehabilitation and non-home discharge placement. This in turn potentially adds additional concerns regarding hospital/provider reimbursement in light of the current Medicare/Medicaid model for arthroplasty surgeons, thus creating a recurrent cycle in which disparities in TJA reflect the complex interplay of overall health disparities and access inequalities associated with racial and ethnic biases. Literature demonstrating evidenced-based interventions to minimize these disparities is sparse, but the multifactorial cause of disparities in TJA highlights the need for multifaceted solutions on both a systemic and individual level."
"Amidst the unexpected losses and challenges of 2020, healthcare disparities and health equity have presided as noteworthy topics of national discussion among healthcare workers, governmental officials, and society at large. Health equity, defined as the opportunity for everyone to be as healthy as possible, may be achieved through the alleviation of healthcare disparities. Healthcare disparities are defined as ""preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations."" While these concepts may be perceived as a departure from the core responsibility of plastic surgeons, it is of paramount importance to recognize how race, socioeconomic status (SES), and physical environment impact access to care, surgical outcomes, and postoperative recovery for vulnerable populations. In this communication, our purpose is two-fold: 1) to elucidate the existent healthcare disparities and associations with race and SES in craniofacial, trauma, breast, hand, and gender-affirming reconstruction; and 2) provide tangible recommendations to incorporate the concepts of health equity and healthcare disparities in clinical, research, community, and recruitment settings for plastic surgeons. Through such knowledge, plastic surgeons may glean important insights that may enhance the delivery of equitable and accessible care for patients."
"In this review, we aim to provide a summary of the current literature on race and gender disparities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence, stage at diagnosis, treatment and prognosis in the United States.','HCC incidence rates are rising in the U.S. in all racial/ethnic groups except for Asian/Pacific Islanders, with disproportionate rises and the highest rates among Hispanics compared to Blacks and non-Hispanic whites. There are striking sex disparities in HCC incidence and mortality; however, with the shifting epidemiology of HCC risk factors in the U.S, there is recent evidence that HCC is trending towards less male predominance, particularly among younger birth cohorts. Despite significant advances in HCC treatment over the past decade, disparities in HCC surveillance and treatment receipt persist among racial and ethnic minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Black patients continue to experience worse survival outcomes than non-Black patients with HCC.','There are significant racial and gender disparities in HCC incidence, treatment, and mortality in the U.S. Though these disparities are well-documented, data are still limited on the specific determinants driving disparities in HCC. To achieve health equity for all patients with HCC, we must advance beyond simply reporting on disparities and begin implementing targeted interventions to eliminate disparities."
"To assess racial and ethnic disparities in care for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries and whether disparities differ between health system-affiliated physician organizations (POs) and nonaffiliated POs.','We used Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty (MD-PPAS), Medicare Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS), IRS Form 990, 100% Medicare FFS claims, and race/ethnicity estimated using the Medicare Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding 2.0 algorithm.','Using a sample of 16 007 POs providing primary care in 2015, we assessed racial/ethnic disparities on 12 measures derived from claims (2 cancer screenings; diabetic eye examinations; continuity of care; two medication adherence measures; three measures of follow-up visits after acute care; all-cause emergency department (ED) visits, all-cause readmissions, and ambulatory care-sensitive admissions). We decomposed these ""total"" disparities into within-PO and between-PO components using models with PO random effects. We then pair-matched 1853 of these POs that were affiliated with health systems to similar nonaffiliated POs. We examined differences in within-PO disparities by affiliation status by interacting each nonwhite race/ethnicity with an affiliation indicator.','Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty identified POs billing Medicare; PECOS and IRS Form 990 identified health system affiliations. Beneficiaries age 18 and older were attributed to POs using a plurality visit rule.','We observed total disparities in 12 of 36 comparisons between white and nonwhite beneficiaries; nonwhites received worse care in 10. Within-PO disparities exceeded between-PO disparities and were substantively important (>=5 percentage points or>=0.2 standardized differences) in nine of the 12 comparisons. Among these 12, nonaffiliated POs had smaller disparities than affiliated POs in two comparisons (P < .05): 1.6 percentage points smaller black-white disparities in follow-up after ED visits and 0.6 percentage points smaller Hispanic-white disparities in breast cancer screening.','We find no evidence that system-affiliated POs have smaller racial and ethnic disparities than nonaffiliated POs. Where differences existed, disparities were slightly larger in affiliated POs."

Within the White population, the greatest IR difference (78.8%) was between Kentucky (5.9/100,000) and Los Angeles (3.3/100,000) in 30- to 34-year-olds (p < .0001). Within the Black population, the greatest difference (136.2%) was between rural Georgia (30.7/100,000) and California excluding San Francisco-Oakland/San Jose-Monterey/Los Angeles (13/100,000) in 40- to 44-year-olds (p = 0003).','Marked geographic EOCRC disparities exist with disproportionately high IRs in Alaska Natives, Hawaii, and southern registries. Geographic intra-racial disparities are present within White and Black populations. In Blacks, there are disproportionately high EOCRC IRs in rural Georgia. Although vigilance is required in all populations, attention must be paid to these higher risk populations. Potential interventions include assuring early investigation of symptoms, targeting modifiable risk factors and utilizing earlier age 45 screening options supported by some guidelines."
"While cancer mortality has declined by 27% between 1991 and 2016 in the United States, there are large disparities in cancer mortality by racial/ethnic groups, socioeconomic status and access to care. The purpose of this analysis is to compare trends in cancer mortality among regions (Service Planning Areas, SPAs) in Los Angeles (LA) County that vary with respect to racial/ethnic distribution and social determinants of health, including poverty, education and access to care.','We estimated age- and race/ethnicity-standardized mortality for lung, colorectal (CRC) and breast cancer for eight SPAs from 1999 to 2013. We calculated three recommended measures of disparities that reflect absolute, relative and between-group disparities.','In all of LA County, statistically significant declines in age- and race/ethnicity-standardized mortality ranged from 30% for lung cancer to 20% for CRC to 15% for breast cancer. Despite some of the largest declines in the most under-resourced SPAs (South LA, East LA, South Bay), disparities between the lowest and highest mortality by SPA did not significantly change from 1999 to 2013.','Despite significant declines in cancer mortality in LA County from 1999 to 2013, and in racial/ethnic groups, there was little progress toward reducing disparities among SPAs. Highest mortalities for the three cancers were observed in Antelope Valley, San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley, South LA and East LA. Findings demonstrate the importance of examining regional differences in cancer mortality to identify areas with highest needs for interventions and policies to reduce cancer disparities."
"Little is known about children's oral health disparities and their changes in developing countries. This study aimed to measure rural-urban and maternal education-related disparities in dental visits and untreated caries among Chinese children, and to describe their changes between 2005 and 2015.','The 12-year-old children's oral health data were from the 3rd (2005) and 4th (2015) oral health surveys in Beijing, China. Rural-urban disparities and maternal education-related disparities in dental visits and untreated caries were measured. The slope index of inequality (SII) and a relative index of inequality (RII) were applied to reflect the absolute and relative disparities respectively. These were estimated using a generalized linear regression model.','Data were analysed from 388 children in 2005 and 1926 children in 2015. The proportion of 12-year-old schoolchildren who visited the dentist was 24.0% in 2005 and 36.0% in 2015. Untreated caries prevalence in 2005 and 2015 was 20.9% and 16.2% respectively. Rural-urban disparities in dental visits narrowed between 2005 and 2015 (SII: -10.75 to -3.30, RII: 0.55 to 0.87), and maternal education-related disparities in dental visits also decreased during this decade (SII: -18.52 to -8.49, RII: 0.38 to 0.65). These changes were statistically significant. For disparities in untreated caries, only maternal education-related disparities in untreated caries in 2015 were found. The SII and RII were 6.39% (95% CI: 1.65, 11.13) and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.20) respectively. The change in disparities in untreated caries was not statistically significant for rural-urban disparities (P = .319) or maternal education-related disparities (P = .501).','These findings indicate that in Beijing, China, disparities in children's dental visits narrowed between 2005 and 2015. However, maternal education-related disparities in dental visits and in untreated caries were still apparent, suggesting that policies to improve children's oral healthcare utilization equality should target the children with less-educated mothers."
"Many strategies to alleviate racial/ethnic disparities in surgical care target healthcare providers. Yet limited data exists about the perception of disparities among the range of clinical staff who work in perioperative settings. Such information could help initiate conversations about disparities in perioperative care and, if necessary, implement interventions to alleviate them. Our aim was to evaluate the association between sociodemographic characteristics, clinical position (physicians and non-physicians) and perception of perioperative disparities at a large tertiary care center.','We surveyed perioperative staff at the institution using an anonymous online survey. Primary outcome was respondents' perception of disparities in perioperative care at the institution due to patients' insurance status/type, ability to speak English, education, and racial/ethnic minority status. The association between clinical position (physician vs. non-physician) and perception of disparities was assessed in bivariate and then multivariable analysis, adjusting for respondents' race, sex, age, and years at the institution. Secondary outcomes included perception of disparities in perioperative care in the United States due to patients' insurance status/type, ability to speak English, education, and racial/ethnic minority status.','217 completed questions that could be analyzed. Among these responders, 101 were physicians (46.5%), 165 (76.0%) were white, and 144 (66.4.%) were female. Bivariate and multivariate analysis revealed that physicians had higher perception of disparities in perioperative care at the institution based on patients' ability to speak English, education, and racial/ethnic minority status. Physicians also had higher perceptions of disparities in perioperative care in the United States than non-physicians.','Physicians reported higher perceptions of disparities in perioperative care than non-physicians, potentially explained by differences in training or contact with patients. Such findings serve as a first step at examining and discussing disparities in perioperative care and warrant further study."
"We write this article amid a global pandemic and a heightened awareness of the underlying structural racism in the United States, unmasked by the recent killing of George Floyd and multiple other unarmed Black Americans (Spring 2020). Our purpose is to highlight the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) on stroke disparities, to inspire dialogue, to encourage research to deepen our understanding of the mechanism by which SDOH impact stroke outcomes, and to develop strategies to address SDOH and reduce stroke racial/ethnic disparities. We begin by defining SDOH and health disparities in today's context; we then move to discussing SDOH and stroke, particularly secondary stroke prevention, and conclude with possible approaches to addressing SDOH and reducing stroke disparities. These approaches include (1) building on prior work; (2) enhancing our understanding of populations and subpopulations, including intersectionality, of people who experience stroke disparities; (3) prioritizing populations and points along the stroke care continuum when racial/ethnic disparities are most prominent; (4) understanding how SDOH impact stroke disparities in order to test SDOH interventions that contribute to the disparity; (5) partnering with communities; and (6) exploring technological innovations. By building on the prior work and expanding efforts to address SDOH, we believe that stroke disparities can be reduced."
"Out-of-pocket costs may significantly dampen patients' willingness to adopt preventive procedures. This is especially true for colonoscopies, which typically involved relatively high cost-sharing requirements prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) implementation in 2011.','We aim to examine the effects of income-related disparities in colonoscopy use in the years prior to and immediately after the implementation of the ACA. Further, we quantify the contributions of different factors in explaining the disparities in the use of colonoscopies among elderly population with health insurance coverage.','Five cycles (2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016) of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were utilized. To examine income-related disparities in the use of CRC, individuals aged 65-75 were included, and the concentration index (CI) was calculated before and after the implementation of ACA. To identify and quantify the contribution of different factors, a decomposition analysis of CI was conducted.','CIs decreased from 0.1935 in pre-ACA years to 0.1813 in the post-ACA years among the elderly, indicating that the disparities in the use of colonoscopy was relatively low and the disparities index declined after the implementation of ACA. Decomposition analyses showed that whereas decreases in disparities derived largely from income and educational level, higher level of income and educational attainment were major contributors to the observed disparities in colonoscopy use.','Our findings indicate that the ACA's removal of financial barriers may have contributed toward the reduction in disparities of colonoscopy use. More direct interventions, e.g., improved knowledge, better access and lower indirect cost will be helpful in improving screening among low-income and low-educational attainment households."
"The current study examined the role of perceived treatment need in explaining racial/ethnic disparities in treatment utilization for a substance use disorder (SUD).','We pooled data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey for years 2014-2017. The analytic sample included adult white, Black, and Latino participants with a past-year SUD (n = 16,393). Multivariable logistic regressions examined racial/ethnic disparities in perceived treatment need-the perception of needing mental health and/or SUD treatment services within the past 12 months-and utilization of past-year substance use, mental health, and any treatment.','Latinos with SUD were less likely to perceive a need for treatment than whites. Black and Latino participants, relative to white participants, had lower odds of past-year treatment utilization, regardless of treatment type. In models stratified by perceived treatment need, racial/ethnic differences in the use of past-year SUD treatment and any treatment service were only significant among persons without a perceived need for treatment. We found no disparities in use of mental health treatment.','Adults with SUD have low perceived treatment need overall but especially among Latinos. Furthermore, Black and Latino disparities in SUD treatment use may be driven in part by lower perceived need for treatment. Interventions that promote better perceived need and delivery models that strengthen the integration of SUD treatment in mental health services may help to reduce these disparities."
"Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to improve functional status, quality of life, and recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Despite its demonstrated compelling benefits and guideline recommendation, CR is underutilized, and there are significant disparities in CR utilization particularly by race, ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence and drivers of these disparities and recommend potential solutions.','In this review, key studies documenting disparities in CR referrals, enrollment, and completion are discussed. Additionally, potential mechanisms for these disparities are summarized and strategies are reviewed for addressing them.','There is a wealth of literature demonstrating disparities among racial and ethnic minorities, women, those with lower income and education attainment, and those living in rural and dense urban areas. However, there was minimal focus on how the social determinants of health contribute to the observed disparities in CR utilization in many of the studies reviewed. Interventions such as automatic referrals, inpatient liaisons, mitigation of economic barriers, novel delivery mechanisms, community partnerships, and health equity metrics to incentivize health care organizations to reduce care disparities are potential solutions."
"Health disparities correspond to differences in disease burden and mortality among socially defined population groups. Such disparities may emerge according to race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and a variety of other social contexts, and are documented for a wide range of diseases. Here, we provide a transdisciplinary perspective on the contribution of epigenetics to the understanding of health disparities, with a special emphasis on disparities across socially defined racial/ethnic groups. Scientists in the fields of biological anthropology, bioinformatics and molecular epidemiology provide a summary of theoretical, statistical and practical considerations for conducting epigenetic health disparities research, and provide examples of successful applications from cancer research using this approach."
"To examine mediation and moderation of racial/ethnic all-cause mortality disparities among Veteran Health Administration (VHA)-users by neighborhood deprivation and residential segregation.','Electronic medical records for 10/2008-9/2009 VHA-users linked to National Death Index, 2000 Area Deprivation Index, and 2006-2009 US Census.','Racial/ethnic groups included American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN), Asian, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic white (reference). We measured neighborhood deprivation by Area Deprivation Index, calculated segregation for non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and AI/AN using the Isolation Index, evaluated mediation using inverse odds-weighted Cox regression models and moderation using Cox regression models testing for neighborhood*race/ethnicity interactions.','Mortality disparities existed for AI/ANs (HR = 1.07, 95%CI:1.01-1.10) but no other groups after covariate adjustment. Neighborhood deprivation and Hispanic segregation neither mediated nor moderated AI/AN disparities. Non-Hispanic black segregation both mediated and moderated AI/AN disparities. The AI/AN vs. non-Hispanic white disparity was attenuated for AI/ANs living in neighborhoods with greater non-Hispanic black segregation (P = .047). Black segregation's mediating effect was limited to VHA-users living in counties with low black segregation. AI/AN segregation also mediated AI/AN mortality disparities in counties that included or were near AI/AN reservations.','Neighborhood characteristics, particularly black and AI/AN residential segregation, may contribute to AI/AN mortality disparities among VHA-users, particularly in communities that were rural, had greater black segregation, or were located on or near AI/AN reservations. This suggests the importance of neighborhood social determinants of health on racial/ethnic mortality disparities. Living near reservations may allow AI/AN VHA-users to maintain cultural and tribal ties, while also providing them with access to economic and other resources. Future research should explore the experiences of AI/ANs living in black communities and underlying mechanisms to identify targets for intervention."
"In an era of tremendous medical advancements, it is important to characterise and address inequities in the provision of health care and in outcomes. There is a large body of evidence describing such disparities by race or ethnicity and socioeconomic position in critically ill adults; however, this important issue has received less attention in children and adolescents (aged ≤21 years). This Review presents a summary of the available evidence on disparities in outcomes in paediatric critical illness in the USA as a result of racism and socioeconomic privilege. The majority of evidence of racial and socioeconomic disparities in paediatric critical care originates from the USA and is retrospective, with only one prospective intervention-based study. Although there is mixed evidence of disparities by race or ethnicity and socioeconomic position in general paediatric intensive care unit admissions and outcomes in the USA, there are striking trends within some disease processes. Notably, there is evidence of disparities in management and outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, asthma, severe trauma, sepsis, and oncology, and in families' perceptions of care. Furthermore, there is clear evidence that critical care research is limited by under-enrolment of participants from minority race or ethnicity groups. We advocate for rigorous research standards and increases in the recruitment and enrolment of a diverse range of participants in paediatric critical care research to better understand the disparities observed, including the effects of racism and poverty. A clearer understanding of when, where, and how such disparities affect patients will better enable the development of effective strategies to inform practice, interventions, and policy."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in health behaviors and disease outcomes on the national level have persisted over time despite overall improvements in public health. To better understand the changes over time in racial/ethnic health disparities at the county level, we examined the Allegheny County Health Survey (ACHS) for Pittsburgh, PA and the surrounding area, which was conducted in 2009/2010 and 2015/2016 using random digit dialing of residents aged 18 and older. The prevalence rates and rate ratios at each time period were calculated using survey weights and general linear models. The change in prevalence over time was calculated using race-time interaction terms. The results showed a significant improvement in asthma, stroke, cholesterol, and fair or poor health disparities as well as persistent disparities in diabetes and hypertension after adjustment for socioeconomic factors. The change over time in the prevalence of fair or poor health in black compared to white respondents was significant, with absolute improvement of approximately 5% versus < 1%, respectively (p = 0.01). These findings demonstrate that some disparities improved while others persist, noting the importance of monitoring the changes over time at the local health department level."
"The five-year survival rate of childhood cancer has increased substantially over the past 50 yr; however, racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes of survival have not been systematically reviewed. This scoping review summarized health disparities between racial/ethnic minorities (specifically non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic) and non-Hispanic White childhood cancer survivors, and elucidated factors that may explain disparities in health outcomes. We used the terms ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""childhood cancer"", ""pediatric cancer"", and ""survivor"" to search the title and abstract for the articles published in PubMed and Scopus from inception to February 2021. After removing duplicates, 189 articles were screened, and 23 empirical articles were included in this review study. All study populations were from North America, and the mean distribution of race/ethnicity was 6.9% for non-Hispanic Black and 4.5% for Hispanic. Health outcomes were categorized as healthcare utilization, patient-reported outcomes, chronic health conditions, and survival status. We found robust evidence of racial/ethnic disparities over four domains of health outcomes. However, health disparities were explained by clinical factors (e.g., diagnosis, treatment), demographic (e.g., age, sex), individual-level socioeconomic status (SES; e.g., educational attainment, personal income, health insurance coverage), family-level SES (e.g., family income, parent educational attainment), neighborhood-level SES (e.g., geographic location), and lifestyle health risk (e.g., cardiovascular risk) in some but not all articles. We discuss the importance of collecting comprehensive social determinants of racial/ethnic disparities inclusive of individual-level, family-level, and neighborhood-level SES. We suggest integrating these variables into healthcare systems (e.g., electronic health records), and utilizing information technology and analytics to better understand the disparity gap for racial/ethnic minorities of childhood cancer survivors. Furthermore, we suggest national and local efforts to close the gap through improving health insurance access, education and transportation aid, racial-culture-specific social learning interventions, and diversity informed training."
"To examine trends in mental health care use for Black and Latinx children and adolescents.','Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2010-2017 were analyzed to assess trends among youth ages 5-17 in use and expenditures for any mental health care, outpatient mental health care, and psychotropic medication prescription fills. Unadjusted trends for all youth and the subpopulation of youth reporting need for mental health care and disparities adjusting for need were examined.','Between 2010 and 2017, Black youth rates of any past year mental health care use decreased (from 9% to 8%), while White (from 13% to 15%) and Latinx (from 6% to 8%) youth rates increased. Among the subpopulation with need and in regression analysis adjusting for need, we identified significant Black-White and Latinx-White disparities in any mental health care use and any outpatient mental health care use in 2010-2011 and 2016-2017, with significant worsening of Black-White disparities over time. White youth were more than twice as likely as Latinx youth to use psychotropic medications, and Latinx-White and Black-White disparities in psychotropic medication prescription fills persisted over time. Black-White disparities existed in overall mental health expenditures (2016-2017) and outpatient mental health expenditures (2010-2011 and 2016-2017).','Affordable, ubiquitous access to mental health care for Black and Latinx youth remains an elusive target. Significant disparities exist in receiving mental health care despite reforms and policies designed to increase mental health care access in the general population. Additional outreach and treatment strategies tailored to the cultural, linguistic, and structural needs of youth of color are required."
"Our objective was to review the role of maternal health disparities and mental health in the maternal mortality crisis in the USA, and discuss how perinatal care quality improvement in these areas is a critical lever for reducing maternal death. This paper summarizes content from a plenary talk delivered at the 2020 Biennial Meeting of the International Marcé Society for Perinatal Mental Health, in commemoration of the Society's 40th anniversary. The talk synthesized literature on two characteristics of the maternal mortality crisis in the US: (1) wide racial and ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and severe morbidity and (2) the impact of mental health and substance use disorders on maternal death, and introduced a framework for how health care quality gaps contribute to both of these issues. The US remains an outlier among similar nations in its alarmingly high rates of maternal mortality. Achieving significant progress on this measure will require confronting longstanding racial and ethnic disparities that exist throughout the pregnancy-postpartum continuum, as well as addressing the under-reported issue of maternal self-harm. Suicide and overdose are leading but under-recognized causes of death among pregnant and postpartum women in some states. Health care delivery failures, including inadequate risk assessment, care coordination, and communication, are identified in the literature on drivers of maternal health disparities and self-harm. Many of the same steps to improve quality of perinatal care can help to reduce health disparities and address the essential role of mental health in maternal well-being."
"<b>Background:</b> There are well-documented disparities in lung cancer outcomes across populations. Lung cancer screening (LCS) has the potential to reduce lung cancer mortality, but for this benefit to be realized by all high-risk groups, there must be careful attention to ensuring equitable access to this lifesaving preventive health measure.<b>Objectives:</b> To outline current knowledge on disparities in eligibility criteria for, access to, and implementation of LCS, and to develop an official American Thoracic Society statement to propose strategies to optimize current screening guidelines and resource allocation for equitable LCS implementation and dissemination.<b>Methods:</b> A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in LCS, implementation science, primary care, pulmonology, health behavior, smoking cessation, epidemiology, and disparities research was convened. Participants reviewed available literature on historical disparities in cancer screening and emerging evidence of disparities in LCS.<b>Results:</b> Existing LCS guidelines do not consider racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and sex-based differences in smoking behaviors or lung cancer risk. Multiple barriers, including access to screening and cost, further contribute to the inequities in implementation and dissemination of LCS.<b>Conclusions:</b> This statement identifies the impact of LCS eligibility criteria on vulnerable populations who are at increased risk of lung cancer but do not meet eligibility criteria for screening, as well as multiple barriers that contribute to disparities in LCS implementation. Strategies to improve the selection and dissemination of LCS in vulnerable groups are described."
"Medicare provides nearly universal health insurance to individuals at age 65 years. How eligibility for Medicare affects racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and health is poorly understood.','To assess the association of Medicare with racial and ethnic disparities in access to care and health.','This cross-sectional study uses regression discontinuity to compare racial and ethnic disparities before and after age 65 years, the age at which US adults are eligible for Medicare. There are a total of 2 434 320 respondents in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and 44 587 state-age-year observations in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Data (eg, the mortality rate for individuals age 63 years in New York in 2017) from January 2008 to December 2018. The data were analyzed between February and May 2021.','Eligibility for Medicare at age 65 years.','Proportions of respondents with health insurance, as well as self-reported health and mortality. To examine access, whether respondents had a usual source of care, encountered cost-related barriers to care, or received influenza vaccines was assessed.','Of 2 434 320 participants, 192 346 were Black individuals, 104 294 were Hispanic individuals, and 892 177 were men. Immediately after age 65 years, insurance coverage increased more for Black respondents (from 86.3% to 95.8% or 9.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.6-11.4) and Hispanic respondents (from 77.4% to 91.3% or 13.9 percentage points; 95% CI, 12.0-15.8) than White respondents (from 92.0% to 98.5% or 6.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.1-7.0). This was associated with a 53% reduction compared with the size of the disparity between White and Black individuals before age 65 years (5.7% to 2.7% or 3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.9-5.1; P = .003) and a 51% reduction compared with the size of the disparity between White and Hispanic individuals before age 65 years (14.6% to 7.2% or 7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.3-9.5; P < .001). Medicare eligibility was associated with narrowed disparities between White and Hispanic individuals in access to care, lowering disparities in access to a usual source of care from 10.5% to 7.5% (P = .05), cost-related barriers to care from 11.4% to 6.9% (P < .001), and influenza vaccination rates from 8.1% to 3.3% (P = .01). For disparities between White and Black individuals, access to a usual source of care before and after age 65 years was not significantly different: 1.2% to 0.0% (P = .24), cost-related barriers to care from 5.8% to 4.3% (P = .22), and influenza vaccinations from 11.0% to 10.3% (P = .60). The share of people in poor self-reported health decreased by 3.8 percentage points for Hispanic respondents, 2.6 percentage points for Black respondents, and 0.2 percentage points for White respondents. Mortality-related disparities at age 65 years were unchanged. Medicare's association with reduced disparities largely persisted after the US Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014.','In this cross-sectional study that uses a regression discontinuity design, eligibility for Medicare at age 65 years was associated with marked reductions in racial and ethnic disparities in insurance coverage, access to care, and self-reported health."
"We reviewed the available evidence regarding health disparities in kidney stone disease to identify knowledge gaps in this area.','A literature search was conducted using PubMed®, Embase® and Scopus® limited to articles published in English from 1971 to 2020. Articles were selected based on their relevance to disparities in kidney stone disease among adults in the United States.','Several large epidemiological studies suggest disproportionate increases in incidence and prevalence of kidney stone disease among women as well as Black and Hispanic individuals in the United States, whereas other studies of comparable size do not report racial and ethnic demographics. Numerous articles describe disparities in imaging utilization, metabolic workup completion, analgesia, surgical intervention, stone burden at presentation, surgical complications, followup, and quality of life based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and place of residence. Differences in urinary parameters based on race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status may be explained by both dietary and physiological factors. All articles assessed had substantial risk of selection bias and confounding.','Health disparities are present in many aspects of kidney stone disease. Further research should focus not only on characterization of these disparities but also on interventions to reduce or eliminate them."
"Although research on alcohol-related disparities among women is a highly understudied area, evidence shows that racial/ethnic minority women, sexual minority women, and women of low socioeconomic status (based on education, income, or residence in disadvantaged neighborhoods) are more likely to experience alcohol-related problems. These problems include alcohol use disorder, particularly after young adulthood, and certain alcohol-related health, morbidity, and mortality outcomes. In some cases, disparities may reflect differences in alcohol consumption, but in other cases such disparities appear to occur despite similar and possibly lower levels of consumption among the affected groups. To understand alcohol-related disparities among women, several factors should be considered. These include age; the duration of heavy drinking over the life course; the widening disparity in cumulative socioeconomic disadvantage and health in middle adulthood; social status; sociocultural context; genetic factors that affect alcohol metabolism; and access to and quality of alcohol treatment services and health care. To inform the development of interventions that might mitigate disparities among women, research is needed to identify the factors and mechanisms that contribute most to a group's elevated risk for a given alcohol-related problem."
"We used data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to explore potential explanations for racial/ethnic disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations and mortality. Black adults in every age group were more likely than White adults to have health risks associated with severe COVID-19 illness. However, Whites were older, on average, than Blacks. Thus, when all factors were considered, Whites tended to be at higher overall risk compared with Blacks, with Asians and Hispanics having much lower overall levels of risk compared with either Whites or Blacks. We explored additional explanations for COVID-19 disparities-namely, differences in job characteristics and how they interact with household composition. Blacks at high risk for severe illness were 1.6 times as likely as Whites to live in households containing health-sector workers. Among Hispanic adults at high risk for severe illness, 64.5 percent lived in households with at least one worker who was unable to work from home, versus 56.5 percent among Black adults and only 46.6 percent among White adults."
"People with disabilities (PwD) have been facing multiple health, social, and economic disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic, stemming from structural disparities experienced for long time. This paper aims to present the PREparedness, RESponse and SySTemic transformation (PRE-RE-SyST): a model for a disability-inclusive pandemic responses and systematic disparities reduction.','Scoping review with a thematic analysis was conducted on the literature published up to mid-September 2020, equating to the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven scientific databases and three preprint databases were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing health and socio-economic disparities experienced by PwD as well as reporting actions to address them. Snowballing searches and experts' consultation were also conducted. Two independent reviewers made eligibility decisions and performed data extractions on any action or recommended action to address disparities. A thematic analysis was then used for the model construction, informed by a systems-thinking approach (i.e., the Iceberg Model).','From 1027 unique references, 84 were included in the final analysis. The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates a four-level strategic action to: 1) Respond to prevent or reduce disability disparities during a pandemic crisis; 2) Prepare ahead for pandemic and other crises responses; 3) Design systems and policies for a structural disability-inclusiveness; and 4) Transform society's cultural assumptions about disability. 'Simple rules' and literature-based examples on how these strategies can be deployed are provided.','The PRE-RE-SyST model articulates main strategies, 'simple rules' and possible means whereby public health authorities, policy-makers, and other stakeholders can address disability disparities in pandemic crises, and beyond. Beyond immediate pandemic responses, disability-inclusiveness is needed to develop everyday equity-oriented policies and practices that can transform societies towards greater resiliency, as a whole, to pandemic and other health and social emergencies."
"Despite a national focus on achieving health equity, limited attention has been paid to behavioral and pediatric health disparities. As the most common pediatric neurobehavioral disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) provides an opportunity to assess the status of pediatric behavior health disparities. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a synthesis of existing research on ADHD diagnostic and treatment disparities between African American and White children.','Studies were systematically identified through searches in PubMed, CINAHL, and APA PsycInfo using the terms attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disparity, race, ethnicity, diagnosis, medication, and treatment. Summary calculations were conducted to report the proportions of studies with statistically significant differences in ADHD diagnosis and treatment between White and African American children, and to describe trends in disparities over time.','Forty-one studies were included in this review. The majority of studies identified significant disparities in ADHD diagnosis and medication treatment between African American and White children. While diagnostic disparities show a trend toward reduction over time, a similar trend was not observed in medication treatment disparities. This synthesis provides a critique of the existing literature and recommendations for practice and future research."
"Black Americans have vastly increased odds and earlier onsets of stress- and age-related disease compared to White Americans. However, what contributes to these racial health disparities remains poorly understood. Using a sample of 1577 older adults (32.7% Black; ages 55-65 at baseline), we examined whether stress, health behaviors, social isolation, and inflammation are associated with racial disparities in self-reported physical health. A latent cumulative stress factor and unique stress-domain specific factors were modeled by applying bifactor confirmatory analysis to assessments across the lifespan (i.e., childhood maltreatment, trauma exposure, discrimination, stressful life events, and indices of socioeconomic status). Physical health, health behavior, and social isolation were assessed using self-report. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assayed from morning fasting serum samples; a z-scored inflammation index was formed across these 2 cytokines. A parallel serial mediational model tested whether race (i.e., Black/White) is indirectly associated with health through the following 3 independent pathways: (1) cumulative stress to preventative health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating) to inflammation, (2) cumulative stress to risky health behaviors (e.g., substance use) to inflammation; and (3) cumulative stress to social isolation to inflammation. There were significant indirect effects between race and self-reported physical health through cumulative stress, preventative health behaviors, and inflammation (B = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01). Specifically, Black Americans were exposed to greater cumulative stress, which was associated with reduced engagement in preventative health behaviors, which was, in turn, associated with greater inflammation and reduced physical health. A unique SES factor also indirectly linked race to physical health through preventative health behaviors. Cumulative stress exposure and unique aspects of socioeconomic status are indirectly associated with Black-White racial health disparities through behavioral (i.e., preventative health behavior) and biological (i.e., inflammation) factors. Culturally responsive evidence-based interventions that enhance engagement in preventative health behaviors are needed to directly confront health disparities. Ultimately, large scale anti-racist public policies that reduce cumulative stress burden (e.g., a living wage, universal healthcare) may best attenuate racial health disparities."
"Health disparities are primarily driven by structural inequality including systemic racism. Medical educators, led by the AAMC, have tended to minimize these core drivers of health disparities. Instead, it has adopted a culture-based agenda through the framework of cultural competence to address disparities despite a paucity of supporting data. Cultural competence is ethnocentric in orientation and its content sustains biases that are long-standing in health care. Moreover, Cultural competence is based on a number of flawed assumptions and is not structured around a set of clearly stated ethical values. In this paper, we will demonstrate ways in which Cultural competence reflects embedded ethnocentrism, perpetuates entrenched biases, and fails to recognize the depth and breadth of systemic racism as these relate to the stated goal of Cultural competence-the mitigation of health disparities. In addition, we offer a reframed approach to health disparities in medical education."
"Adolescents and young adults (AYA, aged 15-39 years) diagnosed with cancer comprise a growing, yet understudied, population. Few studies have examined disparities in cancer survival in underserved and diverse populations of AYA.','Using population-based data from the Texas Cancer Registry, we estimated 5-year relative survival of common AYA cancers and examined disparities in survival by race and ethnicity, neighborhood poverty, urban or rural residence, and insurance type. We also used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine associations of race or ethnicity, neighborhood poverty, urban or rural residence, and insurance type with all-cause mortality.','We identified 55 316 women and 32 740 men diagnosed with invasive cancer at age 15-39 years between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2016. There were disparities in relative survival by race and ethnicity, poverty, and insurance for many cancer types. Racial and ethnic disparities in survival for men with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (74.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 72.1% to 76.7%] White vs 57.0% [95% CI = 51.9% to 61.8%] Black) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (66.5% [95% CI = 61.4% to 71.0%] White vs 44.4% [95% CI = 39.9% to 48.8%] Hispanic) were striking, and disparities remained even for cancers with excellent prognosis, such as testicular cancer (96.6% [95% CI = 95.9% to 97.2%] White vs 88.7% [95% CI = 82.4% to 92.8%] Black). In adjusted analysis, being Black or Hispanic, living in high-poverty neighborhoods, and having Medicaid, other government insurance, or no insurance at diagnosis were associated with all-cause mortality in both women and men (all 2-sided P < .01).','Our study adds urgency to well-documented disparities in cancer survival in older adults by demonstrating persistent differences in relative survival and all-cause mortality in AYAs. Findings point to several areas of future research to address disparities in this unique population of cancer patients."
"Despite Israel's universal health coverage, disparities in health services provision may still exist. We aimed to assess socioeconomic disparities in diabetes prevalence and quality of care among Israeli children, and to assess whether these changed over time.','We used repeated cross-sectional analyses in the setting of the National Program for Quality Indicators in Community Healthcare. The data were derived from electronic medical records from Israel's four health maintenance organizations. The study population included all Israeli children aged 2-17 years in 2011-2018 (2018: N = 2,404,856). Socio-economic position (SEP) was measured using Central Bureau of Statistics data further updated by a private company (Points Business Mapping Ltd), and grouped into 4 categories, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest). We used logistic regression to assess the association of SEP with diabetes prevalence, diabetes clinic visits, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) testing, and poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 9%), and assessed whether these changed over time.','Diabetes prevalence increased with age and SEP, with a total of 3019 children with diabetes. SEP was positively associated with visiting a specialized diabetes clinic (age and sex adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR<sub>SEP 4 vs. 1</sub> 2.45, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.67-3.69)). Although children in higher SEPs were less likely to undergo HbA1c testing (aOR<sub>SEP 4 vs. 1</sub> 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.72), they were also less likely to have poor glycemic control (aOR<sub>SEP 4 vs. 1</sub> 0.25, 95% CI 0.18-0.34). Disparities were especially apparent among children aged 2-9 (6.5% poor glycemic control in SEP 4 vs. 38.2% in SEP 1). Poor glycemic control decreased over time, from 44.0% in 2011 to 34.1% in 2018.','While poor glycemic control rates among children have improved, they remain high compared to rates in adults. Additionally, substantial socioeconomic gaps remain. It is eminent to study the causes of these disparities and develop policies to improve care provided to children in the lower SEP levels, to promote health equity."
"The Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO) supports and facilitates research addressing substance abuse, violence/trauma, and HIV/AIDS among diverse and underserved Latinx populations. CLaRO runs a pilot awards program for early-stage investigators conducting Latinx health disparities research. This pilot awards program was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating innovative responses for research continuity.','The purpose of this commentary is to describe the challenges and innovative research methods developed in response to COVID-19 to continue Latinx health disparities research in the context of COVID-19.','This commentary provides a brief description of each CLaRO pilot project, the challenges introduced by COVID-19, and innovative research methods to continue Latinx health disparities research during and beyond COVID-19.','Despite the challenges COVID-19 presents to the continuity of health disparities research, it also presents unprecedented opportunities to innovate. Such innovation is essential for solving persistent scientific, public health, and clinical challenges underlying current and emerging health disparities."
"Disparities in diagnosis of mental health problems and in access to treatment among racial-ethnic groups are apparent across different behavioral conditions, particularly in the quality of treatment for depression. This study aimed to determine how much disparities differ across providers.','Bayesian mixed-effects models were used to estimate whether disparities in patient adherence to antidepressant medication (N=331,776) or psychotherapy (N=275,095) were associated with specific providers. Models also tested whether providers who achieved greater adherence to treatment, on average, among non-Hispanic white patients than among patients from racial-ethnic minority groups attained lower disparities and whether the percentage of patients from racial-ethnic minority groups in a provider caseload was associated with disparities.','Disparities in adherence to both antidepressant medication and psychotherapy were associated with the provider. Provider performance with non-Hispanic white patients was negatively correlated with provider-specific disparities in adherence to psychotherapy but not to antidepressants. A higher proportion of patients from racial-ethnic minority groups in a provider's caseload was associated with lower adherence among non-Hispanic white patients, lower disparities in adherence to psychotherapy, and greater disparities in adherence to antidepressant medication.','Adherence to depression treatment among a provider's patients from racial-ethnic minority groups was related to adherence among that provider's non-Hispanic white patients, but evidence also suggested provider-specific disparities. Efforts among providers to decrease disparities might focus on improving the general skill of providers who treat more patients from racial-ethnic minority groups as well as offering culturally based training to providers with notable disparities."
"Health disparities are defined on the basis of specific populations that, when compared to the general population, have a significant disparity on the rate of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, or survival. People that experience health disparities can be defined by multiple criteria. As the diversity of the United States broadens and increases, research on the origins and causes of health disparities becomes more important to support a healthy general population. Children are particularly sensitive to and vulnerable to health disparities due to the potentially life long consequences of events during periods of critical organ, intellectual and social development. The concept of health justice whereby each individual has the opportunity to realize their full health potential can only be realized with proper understanding and relevant data to frame practice, policy and actions. The National Children's Study (NCS) was a longitudinal birth cohort study designed to incorporate the principles of the Federal Collaboration on Health Disparities Research in consultation with subject matter experts, community representatives, and ongoing evaluation to ensure high quality and relevant data on factors that impact health outcomes. The NCS developed and tested a model of enrolling a diverse population, capturing and integrating data using a life course framework, constructing individual profiles, then aggregating individuals into groups based on profiles and outcomes. This approach is applicable to other longitudinal cohort studies."
"<b>Objectives:</b> Given the increasing national-level efforts to reduce disparities in obesogenic behaviors in youth, in this paper, we assessed the change in disparities in meeting guidelines for fruits and vegetables intake (FV), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behavior (SB) among adolescents in the United States in the last 13 years. <b>Methods:</b> Using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (2005-2017), overall and characteristic-specific (sex, age, race/ethnicity) disparities ratios for meeting FV, PA, and SB guidelines were calculated using the Extended Gastwirth Index Method. Linear regressions, one-way analysis of variance, and posthoc tests assessed change in characteristic-specific disparities over the years. Linear and quadratic trends assessed change in characteristic-specific contributions to overall disparities. <b>Results:</b> Sex-specific and age-specific disparities increased for meeting FV and PA and decreased for meeting SB guidelines. Race/ethnicity-specific disparities decreased for meeting FV and SB guidelines. Characteristics-specific contributions to overall disparities for each behavior changed over the years. <b>Conclusions:</b> Disparities in obesogenic behaviors are still an ongoing concern despite national-level efforts to improve adolescents' behaviors. The methodology allowed for meaningful disparities ratios that facilitated comparison of categorical demographic characteristics across the years and identifying targetable intervention groups to reduce disparities."
"Nationally representative studies have shown significant racial and socioeconomic disparities in the triage and diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. However, these studies were conducted over a decade ago and have not been updated amidst growing awareness of healthcare disparities.','We aimed to reevaluate the effect of race and insurance type on triage acuity and diagnostic testing to assess if these disparities persist.','We identified ED visits for adults presenting with chest pain in the 2009-2015 National Hospital Ambulatory Health Care Surveys. Using weighted logistic regression, we examined associations between race and payment type with triage acuity and likelihood of ordering electrocardiography (ECG) or cardiac enzymes.','A total of 10,441 patients met inclusion criteria, corresponding to an estimated 51.4 million patients nationwide. When compared with white patients, black patients presenting with chest pain were less likely to have an ECG ordered (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69-0.99). Patients with Medicare, Medicaid, and no insurance were also less likely to have an ECG ordered compared to patients with private insurance (Medicare: OR = 0.79, CI = 0.63-0.99; Medicaid: OR = 0.67, CI = 0.53-0.84; no insurance: OR = 0.68, CI = 0.55-0.84). Those with Medicare and Medicaid were less likely to be triaged emergently (Medicare: OR = 0.84, CI = 0.71-0.99; Medicaid: OR = 0.76, CI = 0.64-0.91) and those with Medicare were less likely to have cardiac enzymes ordered (OR = 0.84, CI = 0.72-0.98).','Persistent racial and insurance disparities exist in the evaluation of chest pain in the ED. Compared to earlier studies, disparities in triage acuity and cardiac enzymes appear to have diminished, but disparities in ECG ordering have not. Given current Class I recommendations for ECGs on all patients presenting with chest pain emergently, our findings highlight the need for improvement in this area."
"<b>Purpose:</b> Research suggests that providers contribute to racial disparities in health outcomes. Identifying modifiable provider perspectives that are associated with decreased racial disparities will help in the design of effective educational interventions for providers. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study investigated the association between primary care provider (PCP) perspectives on race and racial disparities with patient outcomes. <b>Results:</b> Study participants included 40 PCPs (70% White, 30% racial minority) caring for 55 patients (45% White, 55% Black) with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Associations of provider perspectives on race and racial disparities with patient variables (Interpersonal Processes of Care [IPC] Survey, which measures patient's ratings of their provider's interpersonal skills; medication adherence; glycemic control) were measured using Spearman correlation coefficients. Results suggest that Black patients of providers who reported greater skill in caring for Black patients had more positive perceptions of care in three of four IPC subdomains (Spearman correlation coefficients of -0.43, 0.44, 0.46, all with <i>p</i><0.05); however, Black patients of providers who believe that racial disparities are highly prevalent had more negative perceptions of care in three of four IPC subdomains (Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.38, -0.53, -0.51, all with <i>p</i><0.05). These same provider characteristics had no correlation with outcomes of medication adherence and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or among White patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Findings suggest that Black patients of providers who felt better equipped to take care of Black patients had a better experience. Therefore, educational interventions for providers may be most effective if they focus on skill development rather than increasing awareness about racial disparities alone."
"To examine the effectiveness of early and adequate prenatal care (PNC) in reducing racial disparities in pre-term birth (PTB) among low-income women.','This retrospective study examined birth records for 14,950 low-income Black and White women. The primary outcome of interest was racial disparities in PTB. Exposures of interest were first trimester entry into, and adequacy of, PNC. Maternal residential proximity to nearest PNC provider was calculated. Bivariate analyses were performed for PTB by race. Binary logistic regression was performed, controlling for maternal age, smoking status and racial segregation. Attributable risk of PTB for no or late entry into PNC, and percent difference by race was calculated.','We find that early and adequate PNC significantly decreases the risk of preterm birth, however, we find no evidence that this reduces racial disparities. Low income black females in a large metropolitan county have greater geographic access to and utilization of PNC than low-income white females, yet racial disparities in preterm birth remain. Attributable risk of PTB for no or late entry into PNC was lower for Black women (32.2%) than White women (39.4%).','Our findings suggest that adequate PNC alone does not reduce the marked racial disparities in preterm birth.','Public health agencies and health care providers need to look beyond access to care, to achieve racial equity in birth outcomes. Expansion of evidence-based, comprehensive nursing interventions shown to reduce preterm birth, such as the Nurse Family Partnership home visiting program, could contribute to these efforts."
"Although racial disparities in acute pain control are well established, the role of patient analgesic preference and the factors associated with these disparities remain unclear.','To characterize racial disparities in opioid prescribing for acute pain after accounting for patient preference and to test the hypothesis that racial disparities may be mitigated by giving clinicians additional information about their patients' treatment preferences and risk of opioid misuse.','This study is a secondary analysis of data collected from Life STORRIED (Life Stories for Opioid Risk Reduction in the ED), a multicenter randomized clinical trial conducted between June 2017 and August 2019 in the emergency departments (EDs) of 4 academic medical centers. Participants included 1302 patients aged 18 to 70 years who presented to the ED with ureter colic or musculoskeletal back and/or neck pain.','The treatment arm was randomized to receive a patient-facing intervention (not examined in this secondary analysis) and a clinician-facing intervention that consisted of a form containing information about each patient's analgesic treatment preference and risk of opioid misuse.','Concordance between patient preference for opioid-containing treatment (assessed before ED discharge) and receipt of an opioid prescription at ED discharge.','Among 1302 participants in the Life STORRIED clinical trial, 1012 patients had complete demographic and treatment preference data available and were included in this secondary analysis. Of those, 563 patients (55.6%) self-identified as female, with a mean (SD) age of 40.8 (14.1) years. A total of 455 patients (45.0%) identified as White, 384 patients (37.9%) identified as Black, and 173 patients (17.1%) identified as other races. After controlling for demographic characteristics and clinical features, Black patients had lower odds than White patients of receiving a prescription for opioid medication at ED discharge (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27-0.65). When patients who did and did not prefer opioids were considered separately, Black patients continued to have lower odds of being discharged with a prescription for opioids compared with White patients (among those who preferred opioids: OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.24-0.77]; among those who did not prefer opioids: OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.23-0.89]). These disparities were not eliminated in the treatment arm, in which clinicians were given additional data about their patients' treatment preferences and risk of opioid misuse.','In this secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial, Black patients received different acute pain management than White patients after patient preference was accounted for. These disparities remained after clinicians were given additional patient-level data, suggesting that a lack of patient information may not be associated with opioid prescribing disparities.','ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03134092."
"Although Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) programs are recommended to help reduce the burden of diabetes and diabetes-related complications, Florida is one of the states with the lowest DSME participation rates. Moreover, there is evidence of geographic disparities of not only DSME participation rates but the burden of diabetes as well. Understanding these disparities is critical for guiding control programs geared at improving participation rates and diabetes outcomes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (a) investigate geographic disparities of diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates; and (b) identify predictors of the observed disparities in DSME participation rates.','Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for 2007 and 2010 were obtained from the Florida Department of Health. Age-adjusted diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates were computed at the county level and their geographic distributions visualized using choropleth maps. Significant changes in diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates between 2007 and 2010 were assessed and counties showing significant changes were mapped. Clusters of high diabetes prevalence before and after adjusting for common risk factors and DSME participation rates were identified, using Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics, and their geographic distribution displayed in maps. Determinants of the geographic distribution of DSME participation rates and predictors of the identified high rate clusters were identified using ordinary least squares and logistic regression models, respectively.','County level age-adjusted diabetes prevalence varied from 4.7% to 17.8% while DSME participation rates varied from 26.6% to 81.2%. There were significant (p≤0.05) increases in both overall age-adjusted diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates from 2007 to 2010 with diabetes prevalence increasing from 7.7% in 2007 to 8.6% in 2010 while DSME participation rates increased from 51.4% in 2007 to 55.1% in 2010. Generally, DSME participation rates decreased in rural areas while they increased in urban areas. High prevalence clusters of diabetes (both adjusted and unadjusted) were identified in northern and central Florida, while clusters of high DSME participation rates were identified in central Florida. Rural counties and those with high proportion of Hispanics tended to have low DSME participation rates.','The findings confirm that geographic disparities in both diabetes prevalence and DSME participation rates exist. Specific attention is required to address these disparities especially in areas that have high diabetes prevalence but low DSME participation rates. Study findings are useful for guiding resource allocation geared at reducing disparities and improving diabetes outcomes."
"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> We characterize disparities between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults and heterosexual adults across multiple health determinants in a nationally representative sample. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Data on 153,939 adults (including 11,133 LGB adults) were from the 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Separate Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) that gay/lesbian and bisexual adults, respectively, experienced each health determinant, relative to heterosexual adults of the same gender and age group (ages 18-25, 26-34, 35-49, and 50-64). Statistically significant RR estimates were interpreted as a disparity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Bisexual females exhibited disparities on all economic/health care access factors (no college degree, household poverty, means-tested assistance, unemployment, and lacking health insurance) across nearly all age groups; lesbian/gay females exhibited disparities in means-tested assistance and health insurance for some age groups. Notably fewer economic disparities were observed among gay and bisexual males. LGB adults (across identity, gender, and age group) were more likely to live alone, to have never been married, and to report low religious service attendance. Bisexual and lesbian/gay females, across age groups, had 1.7-2.2 times the risk of a lifetime arrest for a criminal offense, relative to same-age heterosexual females. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our results highlight that LGB females, particularly bisexual females, experience significant disparities in economic determinants of health, and all LGB subgroups exhibited disparities in some of the examined social determinants of health. The observed disparities, which spanned across age groups, likely contribute to disparities in physical and mental health observed among LGB adults."
"The purpose of this study was to explore relationships between the Great Recession in the United States and maternal and child health (MCH) disparities in prenatal care, birth weight, gestational age, and infant mortality. Using annual, 2005-2011 individual-level Washington (WA) and Florida (FL) birth certificate data, we analyzed MCH outcome rates and disparities among subpopulation component groups (e.g., subpopulation 'maternal ethnicity' divided into component groups such as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black). We focused on whether disparities widened during two recession periods: Period 1 (December 2007-June 2009-official dates of Great Recession) and Period 2 (January 2010-December 2011) and compared these to a Baseline Period 0 (January 2005-March 2007). Subpopulations (n=14) and component groups (n=47) were identified a priori. Results indicate that disparities widened on at least one MCH outcome for 22 component groups in WA during Period 1 and 37 component groups during Period 2, compared to baseline. In FL, disparities widened for 25 component groups during Period 1 and 31 during Period 2. Disparities increased in both periods on the same outcomes for 11 WA component groups and 7 component groups in FL. Disparity increases tended to cluster among those with young age, low education, and among members of minority race/ethnicity groups-particularly Black mothers. Findings support hypothesized relationships between expected increases in need during the Great Recession, and worsening MCH outcomes and disparities. Compared to baseline, there were more disparity increases in Period 2 than 1. Additional research regarding specific factors influencing changes in disparities are needed."
"Understanding current levels, as well as past and future trends, of the percentage of infants born at low birthweight (LBW) in the United States is imperative to improving the health of our nation. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine recent trends in percentage of LBW, both overall and by maternal race and education subgroups. Studying disparities in percentage of LBW by these subgroups can help to further understand the health needs of the population and can inform policies that can close race and class disparities in poor birth outcomes.','Trends of percentage of LBW in the U.S. from 2003 to 2018, both overall and by race/ethnicity, and from 2007 to 2018 by education and race by education subgroups were analyzed using CDC WONDER Natality data. Disparities were analyzed using between group variance methods.','Percentage of LBW experienced a significant worsening in the most recent 5 years of data, negating nearly a decade of prior improvement. Stark differences were observed by race/ethnicity and by education, with all subgroups experiencing increasing rates in recent years. Disparities also worsened over the course of study. Most notably, all disparities increased significantly from 2014 to 2018, with annual changes near 2-5%.','Recent reversals in progress in percentage of LBW, as well as increasing disparities particularly by race, are troubling. Future study is needed to continue monitoring these trends and analyzing these issues at additional levels. Targets must be set and solutions must be tailored to population subgroups to effectively make progress towards equitable birth outcomes and maternal health."
"Research to understand human genomic variation and its implications in health has great potential to contribute in the reduction of health disparities. Biological anthropology can play important roles in genomics and health disparities research using a biocultural approach. This paper argues that racial/ethnic categories should not be used as a surrogate for sociocultural factors or global genomic clusters in biomedical research or clinical settings, because of the high genetic heterogeneity that exists within traditional racial/ethnic groups. Genetic ancestry is used to show variation in ancestral genomic contributions to recently admixed populations in the United States, such as African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. Genetic ancestry estimates are also used to examine the relationship between ancestry-related biological and sociocultural factors affecting health disparities. To localize areas of genomes that contribute to health disparities, admixture mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often used. Recent GWAS have identified many genetic variants that are highly differentiated among human populations that are associated with disease risk. Some of these are population-specific variants. Many of these variants may impact disease risk and help explain a portion of the difference in disease burden among racial/ethnic groups. Genetic ancestry is also of particular interest in precision medicine and disparities in drug efficacy and outcomes. By using genetic ancestry, we can learn about potential biological differences that may contribute to the heterogeneity observed across self-reported racial groups."
"During 1999-2019, a total of 81,947 unintentional drowning deaths occurred in the United States (1). Drowning is one of the three leading causes of unintentional injury death among persons aged ≤29 years and results in more deaths among children aged 1-4 years than any other cause except birth defects (2). Drowning death rates have decreased since 1990 (declining by 57% worldwide and by 32% in the United States) (3). However, because of racial/ethnic disparities in drowning risk, rates remain high among certain racial/ethnic groups, particularly American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons and Black or African-American (Black) persons (4). To assess whether decreasing drowning death rates have been accompanied by reductions in racial/ethnic disparities, and to further describe these disparities by age group and setting, CDC analyzed U.S. mortality data during 1999-2019. The drowning death rate among persons aged ≤29 years was 1.3 per 100,000 population. The rate per 100,000 among AI/AN persons (2.5) and Black persons (1.8) was higher than among all other racial/ethnic groups and was 2.0 and 1.5 times higher than among White persons (1.2). Racial/ethnic disparities in drowning death rates did not significantly decline for most groups, and the disparity in rates among Black persons compared with White persons increased significantly from 2005-2019. Drowning death rates are associated with persistent and concerning racial/ethnic disparities. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to drowning disparities is needed. Implementing and evaluating community-based interventions, including those promoting basic swimming and water safety skills, among disproportionately affected racial/ethnic groups could help reduce drowning disparities."
"Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving therapy; therefore, equitable distribution of this scarce resource is of paramount importance. We searched contemporary literature on racial, gender, and socioeconomic disparities across the LT care cascade in referral, waitlist practices, allocation, and post-LT care. We subsequently identified gaps in the literature and future research priorities. Studies found that racial and ethnic minorities (Black and Hispanic patients) have lower rates of LT referral, more advanced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma at diagnosis, and are less likely to undergo living donor LT (LDLT). Gender-based disparities were observed in waitlist mortality and LT allocation. Women have lower LT rates after waitlisting, with size mismatch accounting for much of the disparity. Medicaid insurance has been associated with higher rates of chronic liver disease and poor waitlist outcomes. After LT, some studies found lower overall survival among Black compared with White recipients. Studies have also shown lower literacy and limited educational attainment were associated with increased posttransplant complications and lower use of digital technology. However, there are notable gaps in the literature on disparities in LT. Detailed population-based estimates of the advanced liver disease burden and LT referral and evaluation practices, including for LDLT, are lacking. Similarly, little is known about LT disparities worldwide. Evidence-based strategies to improve access to care and reduce disparities have not been comprehensively identified. Prospective registries and alternative ""real-world"" databases can provide more detailed information on disease burden and clinical practices. Modeling and simulation studies can identify ways to reduce gender disparities attributed to size or inaccurate estimation of renal function. Mixed-methods studies and clinical trials should be conducted to reduce care disparities across the transplant continuum."
"Despite significant progress in the prevention and treatment of HIV, disparities in rates of infection remain among key groups in the United States, including blacks and African Americans; Hispanics/Latinos; and men who have sex with men (MSM). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' initiative, <i>Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America</i>, calls for addressing HIV-related disparities and reducing stigma and discrimination associated with HIV. The goal of this literature review was to identify approaches for effectively communicating about health disparities across the HIV care continuum. We reviewed the literature to investigate strategies used to communicate health disparities and to identify potential unintended adverse effects resulting from this messaging. Messages about health disparities often target subgroups at higher risk and can be framed in a variety of ways (e.g., social comparison, progress, impact, etiological). Studies have examined the effects of message framing on the risk perceptions, emotional reactions, and behaviors of individuals exposed to the messaging. The evidence points to several potential unintended adverse effects of using social comparison framing and individual responsibility framing to communicate about health disparities, and visual images and exemplars to target messages to higher-risk subgroups. There is not yet a clear evidence-based approach for communicating about health disparities and avoiding potential unintended effects. However, we offer recommendations for communicating about HIV-related disparities based on our findings. Because we found limited literature that addressed our research questions in the context of HIV, we propose a research agenda to build an evidence base for developing effective messages about HIV-related disparities."
"People with disabilities may be disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We synthesize the literature on broader health and social impacts on people with disabilities arising from lockdown-related measures.','Scoping review with thematic analysis. Up to mid-September 2020, seven scientific databases and three pre-print servers were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Snowballing searches and experts' consultation also occurred. Two independent reviewers took eligibility decisions and performed data extractions.','Out of 1026 unique references, 85 addressed lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Ten primary and two central themes were identified: (1) Disrupted access to healthcare (other than for COVID-19); (2) Reduced physical activity leading to health and functional decline; (3) From physical distance and inactivity to social isolation and loneliness; (4) Disruption of personal assistance and community support networks; (5) Children with disabilities disproportionally affected by school closures; (6) Psychological consequences of disrupted routines, activities, and support; (7) Family and informal caregiver burden and stress; (8) Risks of maltreatment, violence, and self-harm; (9) Reduced employment and/or income exacerbating disparities; and (10) Digital divide in access to health, education, and support services. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and structural, pre-pandemic disparities were the central themes.','Lockdown-related measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can disproportionally affect people with disabilities with broader impact on their health and social grounds. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and pre-pandemic disparities created structural disadvantages, exacerbated during the pandemic. Both structural disparities and their pandemic ramifications require the development and implementation of disability-inclusive public health and policy measures."
"Many childhood cancer survivors experience disparities due to barriers to recommended survivorship care. With an aim to demonstrate evidence-based approaches to alleviate barriers and decrease disparities, we conducted a scoping review of (1) proposed strategies and (2) evaluated interventions for improving pediatric cancer survivorship care.','We searched research databases (PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO), research registries, and grey literature (websites of professional organizations and guideline clearing houses) for guidelines and published studies available through October 2020 (scoping review registration: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/D8Q7Y ).','We identified 16 proposed strategies to address disparities and barriers endorsed by professional organizations including clinical practice guidelines (N=9), policy statements (N=4), and recommendations (N=3). Twenty-seven published studies evaluated an intervention to alleviate disparities or barriers to survivorship care; however, these evaluated interventions were not well aligned with the proposed strategies endorsed by professional organizations. Most commonly, interventions evaluated survivorship care plans (N=11) or models of care (N=11) followed by individual survivorship care services (N=9). Interventions predominantly targeted patients rather than providers or systems and used technology, education, shared care, collaboration, and location-based interventions.','Published studies aimed at overcoming disparities and barriers to survivorship care for childhood cancer survivors revealed that gaps remain between published recommendations and empirical evaluations of interventions aiming to reduce barriers and disparities.','Additional research is needed to identify evidence-based interventions to improve survivorship care for childhood cancer survivors."
"Data suggest that there were disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, and these may inform COVID-19 vaccination efforts. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them.','We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception through May 8, 2020. Observational studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, and disability status in US settings were included. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility. Single-reviewer data abstraction was confirmed by a second reviewer. We conducted independent dual quality assessment, and collective strength of evidence assessment.','We included 21 studies. African American/Black, Latino, and low-socioeconomic status participants had disproportionately lower H1N1 vaccination rates (low- to moderate-strength evidence). However, Latinos were more likely than Whites to intend to be vaccinated, and African American/Blacks and participants with lower-socioeconomic status were just as likely to intend to be vaccinated as their White and higher-socioeconomic status counterparts (low-strength evidence). Vaccine uptake for other groups has been insufficiently studied. Factors potentially contributing to disparities in vaccine uptake included barriers to vaccine access, inadequate information, and concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Studies were largely cross-sectional. Many of the studies are a decade old and were conducted in the context of a different pandemic. The categorization of racial and ethnic groups was not consistent across studies and not all groups were well-studied.','Efforts to avoid disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake should prioritize vaccine accessibility and convenience in African American/Black, Latino, and low-SES communities; engage trusted stakeholders to share vaccine information; and address concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.','Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, Health Services Research & Development.','PROSPERO CRD42020187078."
"Health disparities research often focuses on the social patterning of health outcomes. Increasingly, there has been an emphasis on understanding the mechanisms perpetuating disparities, even after issues of patient access to health services are addressed. The following study utilizes a novel dataset of electronic medical records (EMR), radiology records, and U.S. Census data to investigate the racial/ethnic patterning of provider-patient communication among patients diagnosed with incidental medical findings requiring follow-up. My results indicate that racial/ethnic disparities in follow-up adherence stem from initial disparities in provider-patient communication. These communication disparities persist even after accounting for multiple socioeconomic, health, and provider characteristics, indicating a bias in medicine, whereby providers are less likely to communicate information about incidental medical findings to patients of color relative to White patients. This paper has important clinical implications, as it sheds new light on why we might see low adherence to medical advice among patients of color. Findings also have social, political, and policy relevance, as they suggest an important mechanism through which health inequalities persist. To finally eliminate racial/ethnic health inequalities in the United States, racial bias and discrimination within medical and public health infrastructures must be eliminated."
"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Expanding access to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the national goal for HCV elimination, but important urban-rural disparities exist in DAA use. Evidence is needed to evaluate intervention efforts to reduce urban-rural disparities in DAA utilization. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We used Medicare data to compare DAA use between urban HCV patients and rural HCV patients in two states: State A with a telementoring approach to train rural providers to treat HCV patients and State B without such an intervention. We focused on DAA utilization among newly diagnosed HCV patients in 2014-2016 and defined DAA use as filling at least one prescription of DAAs during 2014-2017. We classified patient's urban-rural status based on their ZIP code of residence. We assessed overtime changes in urban-rural disparities in DAA utilization for each state using multivariable cause-specific Cox regression analyses with time-varying hazard ratios. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Among 1,872 new HCV patients in State A, 135 (17.00%) rural patients and 243 (22.54%) urban patients received DAAs in 2014-2017. Although there was noticeable urban-rural disparities in DAA use during the first 24 months of follow-up (hazard ratios [HRs] = 0.73 [0.51 to 1.03] for 0-12 months and 0.61 [0.39 to 0.95] for 13-24 months), the disparities became nonsignificant afterward (HR = 1.06 [0.58 to 1.93] after 24 months). Most DAA users in rural areas (94, 70%) in State A received DAAs prescribed by primary care providers (PCPs). In State B, among 8,928 new HCV patients, 227 (18.22%) rural patients and 1,600 (20.83%) urban patients received DAAs in 2014-2017. Rural patients were less likely to receive DAAs over time (HR = 1.12 [0.93 to 1.36] in the first 12 months and HR = 0.62 [0.40 to 0.96] after 24 months). Only 81 (36%) DAA users in rural areas in State B were treated by PCPs. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our study suggests that the telementoring approach may help reduce urban-rural disparities in DAA utilization."
"Disparities in the stage at diagnosis of endometrial cancer (EC) account for a significant proportion of the disparities in morbidity and mortality experienced by vulnerable groups in the USA. Evidence suggests that disparities in timeliness of care and treatment play a significant role in stage at diagnosis. Despite an increase in literature on EC disparities, the issue remains largely unchanged. The objectives of this review will be to synthesize the evidence to identify important remaining research questions and inform future interventions to reduce the disparity in stage at diagnosis of EC in the USA.','This scoping review protocol will use the five-step framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. A literature search will be conducted from January 2000 onwards in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Studies on delays in care of EC will be included if they were published in English and reported findings for the US population. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. The study methodological quality and bias will be appraised using appropriate tools. A narrative summary of findings will be conducted. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., content and thematic analysis) methods. The literature search, data extraction, and evidence synthesis will be informed by the Pathway to Treatment Model, which divides time to cancer care initiation into appraisal, help-seeking, diagnostic, and pre-treatment intervals. Results will be reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement.','EC disparities research is currently benefitting form a growing expectation that studies have a real impact on disparities. Patient, healthcare, and disease factors impact the amount of time patients spend in different intervals of the Pathway to Treatment Model, so research and interventions aimed at reducing disparities in EC survival should be designed with cognizance to how these factors impact their target population. Reviews on disparities in stage at diagnosis of EC exist but do not provide a comprehensive picture of the pathway to treatment. This review will seek to provide an expanded bedrock of evidence for future studies to build on as they aim to more actively reduce EC disparities.','Open Science Framework ( osf.io/v2zxy )."
"Incidence and mortality from COVID-19 are starkly elevated in poor, minority and marginalized communities. These differences reflect longstanding disparities in income, housing, air quality, preexisting health status, legal protections, and access to health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences have made these ancient disparities plainly visible.','As scholars in Catholic research universities committed to advancing both scientific knowledge and social justice, we examined these disparities through the lenses of both epidemiology and ethics.','We see these widening disparities as not only as threats to human health, societal stability, and planetary health, but also as moral wrongs - outward manifestations of unrecognized privilege and greed. They are the concrete consequences of policies that promote structural violence and institutionalize racism.','We encourage governments to take the following three scientific and ethical justified actions to reduce disparities, prevent future pandemics, and advance the common good: (1) Invest in public health systems; (2) Reduce economic inequities by making health care affordable to all; providing education, including early education, to all children; strengthening environmental and occupational safeguards; and creating more just tax structures; <i>and</i> (3) Preserve our Common Home, the small blue planet on which we all live."
"It may seem unlikely that the field of radiology perpetuates disparities in health care, as most radiologists never interact directly with patients, and racial bias is not an obvious factor when interpreting images. However, a closer look reveals that imaging plays an important role in the propagation of disparities. For example, many advanced and resource-intensive imaging modalities, such as MRI and PET/CT, are generally less available in the hospitals frequented by people of color, and when they are available, access is impeded due to longer travel and wait times. Furthermore, their images may be of lower quality, and their interpretations may be more error prone. The aggregate effect of these imaging acquisition and interpretation disparities in conjunction with social factors is insufficiently recognized as part of the wide variation in disease outcomes seen between races in America. Understanding the nature of disparities in radiology is important to effectively deploy the resources and expertise necessary to mitigate disparities through diversity and inclusion efforts, research, and advocacy. In this article, the authors discuss disparities in access to imaging, examine their causes, and propose solutions aimed at addressing these disparities."
"Improving adolescent sleep health is a national priority for ameliorating health and wellbeing (Healthy People 2020), as the majority of adolescents do not get the minimum recommended amount of 8 h of sleep per night. Prior research has identified sex and ethnoracial disparities in adolescent sleep but has been limited by data availability. National studies have collected reported sleep data, while objective sleep data has been available in community samples only. Using new data from adolescents in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a population-based birth cohort study of children born 1998-2000, we are able to characterize sex and ethnoracial disparities in sleep health in the first national sample of actigraphy-assessed sleep health among adolescents. In cross-sectional analyses, we used linear and logistic regression models to assess sex and ethnoracial disparities in weekday sleep duration, timing, and quality measured using actigraphy collected from 738 adolescents at approximately age 15. We identified sex and ethnoracial group differences in weekday and weekend adolescent sleep duration, with larger disparities on weekends than weekdays. Male adolescents had 27-min shorter nightly sleep durations than females on weeknights. Non-Hispanic black adolescents had 32-min shorter nightly sleep durations than non-Hispanic whites on weekdays and 41-min shorter nightly sleep durations on weekends. While sex disparities persisted after accounting for naps, black-white differences were attenuated by napping such that there was no statistically significant black-white disparity in 24-h sleep on either weekdays or weekends. We did not identify disparities in sleep timing or quality. Future research should investigate the pathways through which these disparities arise, including behavioral and contextual mechanisms."
"The incidence and mortality of early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) are increasing in the United States (US) and worldwide. In the US, there are notable disparities in early-onset CRC burden by race/ethnicity and geography. African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and populations residing in specific regions of the Southern U.S. are disproportionately affected with CRC diagnosed at younger ages, while less is known about disparities in other countries. Reasons for these disparities are likely multi-factorial and potentially implicate differences in health determinants including biology/genetics, diet/environment, individual health behaviors, and access to high-quality health services, as well as social and policy factors. This review summarizes current understanding of early-onset CRC disparities and identifies specific research areas that will inform evidence-based interventions at individual, practice, and policy levels to reduce the global burden of this disease."
"Due to factors associated with structural racism, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV are less likely to be virally suppressed compared to white MSM. Most of these data come from clinical cohorts and modifiable reasons for these racial disparities need to be defined in order to intervene on these inequities. Therefore, we examined factors associated with racial disparities in baseline viral suppression in a community-based cohort of Black and white MSM living with HIV in Atlanta, GA.','We conducted an observational cohort of Black and white MSM living with HIV infection in Atlanta. Enrolment occurred from June 2016 to June 2017 and men were followed for 24 months; laboratory and behavioural survey data were collected at 12 and 24 months after enrolment. Explanatory factors for racial disparities in viral suppression included sociodemographics and psychosocial variables. Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) for Black/white differences in viral suppression. Factors that diminished the PR for race by ≥5% were considered to meaningfully attenuate the racial disparity and were included in a multivariable model.','Overall, 26% (104/398) of participants were not virally suppressed at baseline. Lack of viral suppression was significantly more prevalent among Black MSM (33%; 69/206) than white MSM (19%; 36/192) (crude Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.5). The age-adjusted Black/white PR was diminished by controlling for: ART coverage (12% decrease), housing stability (7%), higher income (6%) and marijuana use (6%). In a multivariable model, these factors cumulatively mitigated the PR for race by 21% (adjusted PR = 1.1 [95% CI: 0.8 to 1.6]).','Relative to white MSM, Black MSM living with HIV in Atlanta were less likely to be virally suppressed. This disparity was explained by several factors, many of which should be targeted for structural, policy and individual-level interventions to reduce racial disparities."
"Racial disparities in surgical outcomes exist for Black patients with IBD compared to White patients. However, previous studies fail to include other racial/ethnic populations. We hypothesized these disparities exist for Hispanic and Asian patients.','This is a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing surgery for IBD using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS- NSQIP) database (2005-2017). Bivariate comparisons and adjusted multivariable regressions were performed to evaluate associations between race and outcomes.','Of 23,901 patients with IBD, the racial/ethnic makeup were: 88.7% White, 7.6% Black, 2.4% Hispanic and 1.4% Asian. Overall mean LOS was 8 days (SD 8.2) and significantly varied between groups (8d for White, 10d for Black, 8.5d for Hispanic, and 11.1d for Asian; p < 0.001). Hispanic patients had the highest odds of readmission (OR: 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.8). Black patients had increased odds of renal insufficiency (OR: 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-2.9), bleeding requiring transfusions (OR: 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-1.9), and sepsis (OR: 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.02) compared to White patients.','Racial disparities exist among IBD patients undergoing surgery. Black, Hispanic and Asian IBD patients experience major disparities in post-operative complications, readmissions and LOS, respectively, when compared to White patients with IBD. Future research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of these disparities including evaluation of social determinants of health."
"Stark racial disparities in disease incidence among American women remain a persistent public health challenge. These disparities likely result from complex interactions between genetic, social, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors. The influence of environmental risk factors, such as chemical exposure, however, may be substantial and is poorly understood.','We quantitatively evaluated chemical-exposure disparities by race/ethnicity, life stage, and time in United States (US) women (n = 38,080) by using biomarker data for 143 chemicals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2014.','We applied a series of survey-weighted, generalized linear models using data from the entire NHANES women population along with cycle and age-group stratified subpopulations. The outcome was chemical biomarker concentration, and the main predictor was race/ethnicity with adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, smoking habits, and NHANES cycle.','Compared to non-Hispanic White women, the highest disparities were observed for non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, Other Hispanic, and Other Race/Multi-Racial women with higher levels of pesticides and their metabolites, including 2,5-dichlorophenol, o,p'-DDE, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, and 2,4-dichlorophenol, along with personal care and consumer product compounds, including parabens and monoethyl phthalate, as well as several metals, such as mercury and arsenic. Moreover, for Mexican American, Other Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black women, there were several exposure disparities that persisted across age groups, such as higher 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol concentrations. Exposure levels for methyl and propyl parabens, however, were the highest in non-Hispanic black compared to non-Hispanic white children with average differences exceeding 4-fold. Exposure disparities for methyl and propyl parabens are increasing over time in Other Race/Multi-Racial women while fluctuating for non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, and Other Hispanic. Cotinine levels are among the highest in Non-Hispanic White women compared to Mexican American and Other Hispanic women with disparities plateauing and increasing, respectively.','We systematically evaluated differences in chemical exposures across women of various race/ethnic groups and across age groups and time. Our findings could help inform chemical prioritization in designing epidemiological and toxicological studies. In addition, they could help guide public health interventions to reduce environmental and health disparities across populations."
"As national HIV prevention goals aim to increase the proportion of persons living with HIV, determining existing disparities in retention in care will allow for targeted intervention. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify existing disparities in retention in care. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guided this systematic review. Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Sociological Collection, PsychInfo, and Cab Direct/Global Health, were systematically searched and twenty studies were included. This review identified disparities in retention in care that have been documented by race, gender, age, HIV exposure, incarceration history, place of birth, and U.S. geographic location. Research is necessary to further identify existing disparities in retention in care and to better understand determinants of health disparities. Additionally, interventions must be tailored to meet the needs of health disparate populations and should be assessed to determine their effectiveness in reducing health disparities."
"Dietary habits are influenced by various determinants that may evolve over time. This study aimed to examine, among adolescents in Belgium, trends in the dietary habits between 1990 and 2014 and to determine changes in family and regional disparities related to diet during this time period. In the 1990, 2002 and 2014 cross-sectional ""Health Behaviour in School-aged Children"" (HBSC) surveys, food consumption was estimated using a short Food Frequency Questionnaire. The Relative Index of Inequality (RII) enabled quantification of the gradients of inequality related to the family structure and to the region for non-daily fruit and vegetable and daily sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption. Between 1990 and 2014, the prevalence of non-daily fruit consumption increased from 27.7% to 60.6%, whereas the daily SSB consumption decreased from 58.9% to 34.8%. Over time, a downward trend in family disparities (<i>p</i> = 0.007) was observed for daily fruit consumption (RII: 1.58 (1.33-1.88) to 1.18 (1.13-1.23)). An upward trend in region-related disparities (p < 0.001) for SSB was found (RII: 1.15 (1.07-1.23) to 1.37 (1.28-1.47)). The overall trend of increasing disparities when dietary habits improved and decreasing disparities when dietary habits worsened highlights the need to implement actions that improve overall dietary habits while ensuring that disparities do not increase."
"Many healthcare providers lack the awareness of health disparities among their patients that precedes action to improve outcomes. Limited health disparities training is a probable contributor. We assessed primary care residents' awareness of racial and ethnic disparities in diabetes, their perceived preparedness to discuss health disparities with patients, and their preferences for training and resources to improve their preparedness. Primary care residents (n = 98) affiliated with two teaching hospitals in North Carolina were invited to complete a 20-question health disparities survey. Fifty-two residents completed the survey (response rate = 53%). Most were non-Hispanic White (54%) and had ≤ 50% African American patients in their panel (65%). Although 83% were aware of higher diabetes prevalence among African Americans, only 31% felt prepared to discuss diabetes health disparities with patients. Their primary concerns included not having information for the discussion (58%) and being unsure how to share information in a way that is easy for patients to understand (48%). Perceived preparedness to discuss health disparities did not differ significantly by primary care resident race or percentage of African American patients in their panel. Residents indicated that having information regarding how to discuss and address health disparities would make them feel more prepared. Cultural competency training and experiential learning were the most preferred methods to learn how to identify and address health disparities. Future health disparities training should focus on improving residents' preparedness to address health disparities in their clinical practice using culturally relevant communication tools and experiential learning opportunities."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States. Whereas racial and ethnic disparities in severe COVID-19-associated outcomes, including mortality, have been documented (1-3), less is known about population-based disparities in infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition, although persons aged <30 years account for approximately one third of reported infections,<sup>§</sup> there is limited information on racial and ethnic disparities in infection among young persons over time and by sex and age. Based on 689,672 U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to CDC's case-based surveillance system by jurisdictional health departments, racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 incidence among persons aged <25 years in 16 U.S. jurisdictions<sup>¶</sup> were described by age group and sex and across three periods during January 1-December 31, 2020. During January-April, COVID-19 incidence was substantially higher among most racial and ethnic minority groups compared with that among non-Hispanic White (White) persons (rate ratio [RR] range = 1.09-4.62). During May-August, the RR increased from 2.49 to 4.57 among non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NH/PI) persons but decreased among other racial and ethnic minority groups (RR range = 0.52-2.82). Decreases in disparities were observed during September-December (RR range = 0.37-1.69); these decreases were largely because of a greater increase in incidence among White persons, rather than a decline in incidence among racial and ethnic minority groups. NH/PI, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons experienced the largest persistent disparities over the entire period. Ensuring equitable and timely access to preventive measures, including testing, safe work and education settings, and vaccination when eligible is important to address racial/ethnic disparities."
"The largest US federal action plan to date for reducing racial disparities in health care was implemented in 2011 and continues today. It is not known whether this program, along with other initiatives, is associated with a decrease in racial disparities in the use of major surgical procedures in the US.','To analyze whether national initiatives are associated with improvement in racial disparities between White and Black patients in the use of surgical procedures in the US.','In this case-control study, the national rates of use for 9 major surgical procedures previously shown to have racial disparities in rates of performance between White and Black adult patients (including angioplasty, spinal fusion, carotid endarterectomy, appendectomy, colorectal resection, coronary artery bypass grafting, total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, and heart valve replacement) were analyzed from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2017. Data analysis was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2020. Population- and sex-adjusted procedural rates during the study period were examined and standardized based on all-payer insurance status. Racial changes were further analyzed by US census division and hospital teaching status for 4 selected procedures: coronary artery bypass grafting, carotid endarterectomy, total hip arthroplasty, and heart valve replacement.','Population- and race-adjusted procedural rates by year, US census division, hospital teaching status, and insurance status.','This study included national inpatient data from 2012 to 2017. In 2012, the national incidence rate of all 9 major surgical procedures was higher in White than in Black individuals. For example, the incidence rate of total knee arthroplasty in 2012 for White males was 184.8 per 100 000 persons and for Black males was 79.8 per 100 000 persons. By 2017, these racial disparities persisted for all 9 procedures analyzed. For example, the incidence rate of total knee arthroplasty in 2017 for White males was 220.5 per 100 000 persons and for Black males was 95.6 per 100 000 persons. Although the disparity gap between White and Black patients narrowed for angioplasty (-20.1 per 100 000 persons in males, -4.2 per 100 000 persons in females), spinal fusion (-7.7 per 100 000 persons in males, -15.0 per 100 000 persons in females), carotid endarterectomy (-4.3 per 100 000 persons in males, -4.6 per 100 000 persons in females), appendectomy (-12.3 per 100 000 persons in males, -12.2 per 100 000 persons in females), and colorectal resection (-9.0 per 100 000 persons in males, -12.7 per 100 000 persons in females), the disparity remained constant for coronary artery bypass grafting and widened for 3 procedures, total hip arthroplasty (11.6 per 100 000 persons in males, 20.8 per 100 000 in females), total knee arthroplasty (19.9 per 100 000 persons in males, 12.0 per 100 000 persons in females), and heart valve replacement(12.4 per 100 000 persons in males, 9.2 per 100 000 persons in females). In 2017, racial differences persisted in all US census divisions and in both urban teaching and urban nonteaching hospitals. When rates were adjusted based on insurance status, Black patients with Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance underwent lower rates of all procedures analyzed compared with White patients. For example, rate of spinal fusion in Black patients was 70.2% of the rate in White patients with Medicare, 56.5% to that of White patients with Medicaid, and 61.2% to that of White patients with private insurance.','Results of this study suggest that despite national initiatives, racial disparities have persisted for all analyzed procedures and worsened for one-third of the analyzed procedures. These disparities were evident regardless of US census division, hospital teaching status, or insurance status. Renewed initiatives to help diminish racial disparities and improve health care equality are warranted."
"All fields of medicine are victim to health inequity worldwide, including rheumatology. While the health system is a key proponent to health access for all, other social determinants of health also impact world health. We describe herein the current state of global healthcare disparities in rheumatology and attempts at optimizing graduate medical education and resources for optimized healthcare, international research collaborations and a future of universal health equity. We performed a comprehensive search through Pubmed using the following keywords: healthcare disparities, medical education, access to care, community health.Key Points• Healthcare disparities are ubiquitous globally, including the field of rheumatology.• The heterogeneity of global healthcare disparities emphasizes the importance of addressing unmet needs at a regional level.• A standardized approach to incorporating healthcare disparities education in the medical field is lacking. Intervening at this level provides a foundation of increasing provider awareness of regional healthcare disparities so as to establish a framework of addressing such disparities in a culturally competent manner."
"Disparities in the treatment of Black and White Americans in police stops are pernicious and widespread. We examined racial disparities in police traffic stops by leveraging data on hundreds of U.S. counties from the Stanford Open Policing Project and corresponding county-level data on implicit and explicit racial attitudes from the Project Implicit research website. We found that Black-White traffic-stop disparities are associated with county-level implicit and explicit racial attitudes and that this association is attributable to racial demographics: Counties with a higher proportion of White residents had larger racial disparities in police traffic stops. We also examined racial disparities in several poststop outcomes (e.g., arrest rates) and found that they were not systematically related to racial attitudes, despite evidence of disparities. These findings indicate that racial disparities in counties' traffic stops are reliably linked to counties' racial attitudes and demographic compositions."
"Syphilis rates have increased substantially over the past decade. Women are an important population because of negative sequalae and adverse maternal outcomes including congenital syphilis. We assessed whether racial and ethnic disparities in primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis among heterosexually active women differ by region and age group.','We synthesized 4 national surveys to estimate numbers of heterosexually active women in the United States from 2014 to 2018 by region, race and ethnicity, and age group (18-24, 25-29, 30-44, and ≥45 years). We calculated annual P&S syphilis diagnosis rates, assessing disparities with rate differences and rate ratios comparing White, Hispanic, and Black heterosexually active women.','Nationally, annual rates were 6.42 and 2.20 times as high among Black and Hispanic than among White heterosexually active women (10.99, 3.77, and 1.71 per 100,000, respectively). Younger women experienced a disproportionate burden of P&S syphilis and the highest disparities. Regionally, the Northeast had the highest Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities using a relative disparity measure (relative rate), and the West had the highest disparities using an absolute disparity measure (rate difference).','To meet the racial and ethnic disparity goals of the Sexually Transmitted Infections National Strategic Plan, tailored local interventions that address the social and structural factors associated with disparities are needed for different age groups."
"Treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has markedly changed in the past decade with the integration of biomarker testing, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and palliative care. These advancements have led to significant improvements in quality of life and overall survival. Despite these improvements, racial and socioeconomic disparities in lung cancer mortality persist. This narrative review aims to assess and synthesize the literature on sociodemographic disparities in the management of advanced NSCLC. A narrative overview of the literature was conducted using PubMed and Scopus and was narrowed to articles published from January 1, 2010, until July 22, 2020. Articles relevant to sociodemographic variation in (I) chemoradiation for stage III NSCLC, (II) molecular biomarker testing, (III) systemic treatment, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, and (IV) palliative and end of life care were included in this review. Twenty-two studies were included. Sociodemographic disparities in the management of advanced NSCLC varied, but recurring findings emerged. Across most treatment domains, Black patients, the uninsured, and patients with Medicaid were less likely to receive recommended lung cancer care. However, some of the literature was limited due to incomplete data to adequately assess appropriateness of care, and several studies were out of date with current practice guidelines. Sociodemographic disparities in the management of advanced lung cancer are evident. Given the rapidly evolving treatment paradigm for advanced NSCLC, updated research is needed. Research on interventions to address disparities in advanced NSCLC is also needed."
"The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, implemented in 2006, increased managed care options for seniors. It introduced insurance plans for prescription drug coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries, whether they were enrolled in FFS or managed care (Medicare Advantage) plans. The availability of drug coverage beginning in 2006 served to free up budgets for FFS Medicare enrollees that could be used to make copayments for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy). In 2007, Medicare eliminated the copayments required by seniors for CRC screening by endoscopy. Later in 2008, CRC screening by colonoscopy became part of the gold standard for CRC screening. This legitimized its use and offered even further encouragement to seniors, who may have been reluctant to undergo the procedure because of the non-pecuniary risks associated with it. In addition, 37 CRC screening interventions occurred during this timeframe to enhance compliance with screening standards. Using multilevel analysis of individuals' endoscopy utilization, derived from 100% FFS Medicare claims, along with county-level market and contextual factors, we compare the periods before and after the MMA (2001-2005 to 2006-2009) to determine whether disparities in the utilization of endoscopic CRC screening occurred or changed over the decade. We examined Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics relative to Whites, and Females relative to Males (with race or ethnicity combined). We examined each state separately for evidence of disparities within states, to avoid confounding by geographic disparities. We expected that the net effect of the policy changes and the targeted interventions over the decade would be to increase CRC screening by endoscopy, reducing disparities. We saw improvements over time (reduced disparities relative to Whites) for Blacks and Hispanics residing in several states, and improvements over time for Females relative to Males in many states. For the vast majority of states, however, disparities persisted with Whites and Males exhibiting greater rates of utilization than other groups. States that undertook the interventions were more likely to have had improvements in disparities or positive disparities for women and minorities. While some gains were made over this time period, the gains were unevenly distributed across the USA and more work needs to be done to reduce remaining disparities."
"Not only do racial and ethnic minority children and adolescents with chronic illness experience disparities in health status and health outcomes, they also experience significant healthcare disparities, including differences in healthcare coverage, access to care, and quality of care. It is well known that the interaction between psychosocial functioning, health behaviors and ethnic and racial disparities, ultimately leads to worse health and psychosocial outcomes in pediatric and AYA chronic illness patient populations, including increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Investigating the impact of racial and ethnic factors on health outcomes, and strategies for reducing these disparities, is of the utmost importance, specifically in life-threatening conditions like cancer and sickle cell disease. This commentary underscores the relative importance of identifying factors that could reduce disparities between minority and non-minority populations. This present paper will focus on the dynamic relationships between health disparities, psychosocial factors and health outcomes within pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease and bone marrow transplant populations, and will offer recommendations for healthcare professionals working with these vulnerable patient populations. The primary goal of this commentary is to provide recommendations for enhancing cultural competency and humility for those working with highly vulnerable patient populations."
"Despite improvements in the prevalence of dental caries, disparities are still observed globally and in the U.S. This study examined whether community water fluoridation (CWF) reduced dental caries disparities in permanent teeth of 10- to 19-year-old schoolchildren in North Carolina. We used cross-sectional data representing K-12 schoolchildren in North Carolina (NC) public schools. A poisson regression model was used to determine whether the association between children's parental educational attainment and the prevalence of dental caries of children differed by children's lifetime CWF exposure. We analyzed data on 2075 students. Among the children without any CWF exposure in their life, statistically significant caries disparities by parental educational attainment were observed. Compared to the children of parents with more than high school education, the relative risk for those with a parent with a high school education was 1.16 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.33) and those with less than a high school education was 1.27 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.60). In contrast, these disparities were not observed among children exposed to CWF throughout their lives. Socioeconomic disparities in dental caries were not observed among 10-19-year-old schoolchildren with lifetime CWF exposure. CWF seemed to reduce dental caries disparities."
"Despite the social disparities in COVID-19 infection, little is known about factors influencing social disparities in preventive behaviors during the pandemic. This study examined how educational disparities in mask-wearing, handwashing, and limiting public outings might be contingent upon three factors: contextual cue of danger, perceived risk of local outbreak, and interventional context with different levels of intensity (i.e, Wuhan vs. other areas). Data were obtained from a telephone survey of 3327 adults, who were recruited through a random-digit-dial method to be representative of all cell phone users in China. Interviews were conducted from 28 April to 26 May 2020. Stratified multiple regression models showed that educational disparities in all three behaviors were only consistently observed among people exposed to context cues of danger, with an enhanced sense of risk of a local outbreak, or in areas other than Wuhan. College education seems to make a difference in handwashing regardless of contextual cues of danger or perception of risk. The findings suggested that, in the process of an epidemic, emerging threats in one's immediate environment or raised awareness of risks are important conditions triggering educational disparities in prevention. However, effective public health interventions could potentially reduce such disparities."
"Non-Hispanic black (NHB) pregnant women disproportionately experience adverse birth outcomes compared to Non-Hispanic white (NHW) pregnant women. The positive effects of prenatal exercise on maternal and neonatal health may mitigate these disparities. This study evaluated the influence of prenatal exercise on racial/ethnic disparities in gestational age (GA), birthweight (BW), and risks of preterm birth (PTB), cesarean section (CS), and low-birthweight (LBW) neonates.','This study performed a secondary data analysis using data from a 24-week, two-arm exercise intervention trial (ENHANCED by Mom). Women with singleton pregnancies (< 16 weeks), aged 18-40 years, BMI between 18.5-34.99 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and no preexisting health conditions were eligible. The aerobic exercisers (EX) participated in 150 min of moderate-intensity weekly exercise while non-exercising controls (CON) attended low-intensity stretching/breathing sessions. Data on GA, PTB (< 37 weeks), BW, LBW (< 2.5 kg), and delivery mode were collected. Poisson, median and linear regressions were performed.','Participants with complete data (n = 125) were eligible for analyses (EX: n = 58, CON: n = 67). NHB pregnant women delivered lighter neonates (β = - 0.43 kg, 95% CI: - 0.68, - 0.18, p = 0.001). After adjusting for prenatal exercise, racial/ethnic disparities in BW were reduced (β = - 0.39 kg, 95% CI: - 0.65, - 0.13, p = 0.004). Prenatal exercise reduced borderline significant racial/ethnic disparities in PTB (p = 0.053) and GA (p = 0.07) with no effects found for CS and LBW.','The findings of this study demonstrate that prenatal exercise may attenuate the racial/ethnic disparities observed in neonatal BW, and possibly GA and PTB. Larger, diverse samples and inclusion of maternal biomarkers (e.g., cytokines) are encouraged to further evaluate these relationships."
"While essential for health and wellness, the various dimensions of sleep health are generally not equitably distributed across the population, and reasons for racial/ethnic sleep disparities are not fully understood. In this review, we describe racial/ethnic sleep disparities and subsequent implications for health from prior and recently conducted epidemiological and clinical studies as well as the potential sleep interventions presented at the 2018 Research Conference on Sleep and the Health of Women at the National Institutes of Health. Given the clear connection between sleep and poor health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, we concluded that future studies are needed to focus on sleep health in general, sleep disorders such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea in particular, and disparities in both sleep health and sleep disorders among women using an intersectional framework. Future research should also integrate sleep into interventional research focused on women's health as these results could address health disparities by informing, for example, future mobile health (mHealth) interventions prioritizing women beyond the clinical setting."
"<b>Objectives</b>: In the general population, the construct of race is associated with disparities in cognitive aging. There are notable racial group disparities and inequities among people living with schizophrenia (PLWSz). Despite the salience of the construct of race in schizophrenia, there remains a knowledge gap about racial disparities in cognitive impairment among older adults in this vulnerable population. Our study uses mediation analysis to examine racial disparities in cognitive impairment among older adults with schizophrenia.<b>Methods</b>: We assess global cognition in PLWSz over age 55 with the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia cognitive test battery in our ""all-comer"" sample (<i>N</i> = 64). The primary exposure is self-reported racial group. We examine mediation of cognitive impairment through educational attainment, adjusting for psychiatric illness severity, history of substance use, and vascular risk factors.<b>Results</b>: There was a Black/non-Black group racial disparity in global cognitive score (-2.8, 95% CI: -4.4, -1.3) after adjusting for confounding and interaction. This disparity was significantly mediated by years of education.<b>Conclusions</b>: There are notable racial disparities in cognitive impairment among older adults with schizophrenia; however, differences in cognitive scores between racial groups are mediated by level of education.<b>Clinical Implications</b>: Social determinants of health, particularly educational attainment, are important risk factors for cognitive impairment in PLWSz and should be considered by clinicians. Early screening and assessment of cognitive symptoms is essential to addressing health disparities/inequalities among older adults living with schizophrenia.<b>Abbreviations CDE</b>: Controlled Direct EffectsHIV: Human Immunodeficiency VirusMATRICS: Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in SchizophreniaMCCB: MATRICS Consensus Cognitive BatteryMTE: Marginal Total EffectsNDE: Natural Direct EffectsPANSS: Positive and Negative Symptom ScalePLWSz: People with schizophrenia."
"Cancer health disparities remain stubbornly entrenched in the US health care system. The Affordable Care Act was legislation to target these disparities in health outcomes. Expanded access to health care, reduction in tobacco use, uptake of other preventive measures and cancer screening, and improved cancer therapies greatly reduced cancer mortality among women and men and underserved communities in this country. Yet, disparities in cancer outcomes remain. Underserved populations continue to experience an excessive cancer burden. This burden is largely explained by health care disparities, lifestyle factors, cultural barriers, and disparate exposures to carcinogens and pathogens, as exemplified by the COVID-19 epidemic. However, research also shows that comorbidities, social stress, ancestral and immunobiological factors, and the microbiome, may contribute to health disparities in cancer risk and survival. Recent studies revealed that comorbid conditions can induce an adverse tumor biology, leading to a more aggressive disease and decreased patient survival. In this review, we will discuss unanswered questions and new opportunities in cancer health disparity research related to comorbid chronic diseases, stress signaling, the immune response, and the microbiome, and what contribution these factors may have as causes of cancer health disparities."
"Medicaid managed care enrollees who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups have historically reported worse care experiences than White enrollees. Few recent studies have identified disparities within and between Medicaid managed care plans. Using 2014-18 data on 242,274 nonelderly Medicaid managed care enrollees in thirty-seven states, we examined racial and ethnic disparities in four patient experience metrics. Compared with White enrollees, minority enrollees reported significantly worse care experiences. Overall adjusted disparities for Black enrollees ranged between 1.5 and 4.5 percentage points; 1.6-3.9 percentage points for Hispanic or Latino enrollees; and 9.0-17.4 percentage points for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander enrollees. Disparities were largely attributable to worse experiences by race or ethnicity within the same plan. For all outcomes, disparities were smaller in plans with the highest percentages of Hispanic or Latino enrollees, and for some outcomes, there were smaller disparities in plans with the highest percentages of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander enrollees. Interventions to mitigate racial and ethnic inequities in care experiences include collection of comprehensive race and ethnicity data, adoption of health equity performance metrics, plan-level enrollee engagement, and multisectoral initiatives to dismantle structural racism."
"Ethnoracial disparities in sleep health across the lifecourse, may underlie other disparities in health and well-being among adults in the United States (U.S.). We evaluated if socioenvironmental stressors, which likely differ by the race/ethnicity of college students, may contribute to sleep disparities in this demographic group.','National Health Interview Survey data pooled from 2004 to 2017 were used to test the hypothesis that ethnoracial disparities in sleep exist among college students residing in dormitories in the U.S.','Nationally representative survey data.','A total of 2,119 college students residing in dormitories (71% White, 16% Black/African-American, 7% Hispanic/Latino, and 6% Asian) participated in the study.','The prevalence of short sleep duration was higher among Black/African-Americans than among White students, but not among Hispanics/Latinos and Asians, after adjusting for age, gender, and region of residence. In fully adjusted models, Black/African-Americans, although no longer statistically significant after adjustments, were more likely to report short sleep duration compared with White students (adjusted prevalence ratio; [aPR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-1.71). The prevalence of separate insomnia symptoms did not differ by ethnoracial group in adjusted models. Only Asian students had a higher prevalence (aPR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.12-1.75) of nonrestorative sleep than White students.','Black/African-American but not Hispanic/Latino or Asian college students were more likely to report short sleep duration than Whites. Insomnia symptoms did not differ between groups, while Asians experienced more nonrestorative sleep. Future studies should investigate the socioenvironmental causes of disparities using longitudinal designs, larger sample sizes, better socioeconomic status (SES) indicators, and objective sleep measures."
"A health disparity is a health outcome that presents in a lesser or greater extent between populations. Health disparities in diseases are products of complex interactions between social, economic, and to a lesser extent, biological factors and can be mediated by structural racism and discriminatory policies. The objective of this review is to understand how both laboratorians and nonlaboratorians think about the relationship between laboratory medicine and health disparities and to highlight ways in which laboratory medicine can play a role in eliminating health disparities.','We developed an electronic survey from which we selected the top responses reported by the 215 participants to frame a discussion around why laboratorians perceive health disparities exists, and how they can reduce health disparities.','We found that both laboratorians and nonlaboratorians feel that laboratory medicine can and should play a role in reducing health disparities using many tools already in use in the clinical laboratory. The skills of laboratory workers in data generation, the establishment of reference ranges, control over the presentation of laboratory results, generation of test menus, and the development of novel diagnostics may impact health disparities. Laboratorians' responses in our survey indicated that they felt that they could reduce health disparities by using laboratory data to proactively track in cooperation with healthcare providers individuals with chronic conditions to prevent acute events, ensuring gender and ethnic diversity in new clinical trials, including appropriate curriculum in laboratory medicine training, using equations and reference intervals based on physiological differences and participating in unconscious bias training."
"Differences in access to stroke care and compliance with standard of care stroke management among patients of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds and sex are well-characterized. However, little is known on the impact of telestroke in addressing disparities in acute ischemic stroke care.','We conducted a retrospective review of acute ischemic stroke patients evaluated over our 17-hospital telestroke network in Texas from 2015-2018. Patients were described as Non-Hispanic White (NHW) male or female, Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) male or female, or Hispanic (HIS) male or female. We compared frequency of tPA and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) utilization, door-to-consultation times, door-to-tPA times, and time-to-transfer for patients who went on to MT evaluation at the hub after having been screened for suspected large vessel occlusion at the spoke.','Among 3873 patients (including 1146 NHW male (30%) and 1134 NHW female (29%), 405 NHB male (10%) and 491 NHB female (13%), and 358 HIS male (9%) and 339 HIS female (9%) patients), we did not find any differences in door-to consultation time, door-to-tPA time, time-to-transfer, frequency of tPA administration, or incidence of MT utilization.','We did not find racial, ethnic, and sex disparities in ischemic stroke care metrics within our telestroke network. In order to fully understand how telestroke alleviates disparities in stroke care, collaboration among networks is needed to formulate a multicenter telestroke database similar to the Get-With-The Guidelines."
"There are well-established disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes by race/ethnicity that result from the interplay between structural, socioeconomic, socio-environmental, behavioural and biological factors. However, large research studies designed to investigate factors contributing to cancer aetiology and progression have mainly focused on populations of European origin. The limitations in clinicopathological and genetic data, as well as the reduced availability of biospecimens from diverse populations, contribute to the knowledge gap and have the potential to widen cancer health disparities. In this review, we summarise reported disparities and associated factors in the United States of America (USA) for the most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and colon), and for a subset of other cancers that highlight the complexity of disparities (gastric, liver, pancreas and leukaemia). We focus on populations commonly identified and referred to as racial/ethnic minorities in the USA-African Americans/Blacks, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders and Hispanics/Latinos. We conclude that even though substantial progress has been made in understanding the factors underlying cancer health disparities, marked inequities persist. Additional efforts are needed to include participants from diverse populations in the research of cancer aetiology, biology and treatment. Furthermore, to eliminate cancer health disparities, it will be necessary to facilitate access to, and utilisation of, health services to all individuals, and to address structural inequities, including racism, that disproportionally affect racial/ethnic minorities in the USA."
"Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI) have risen steadily in recent years, and racial and ethnic minorities have borne the disproportionate burden of STI increases in the United States. Historical inequities and social determinants of health are significant contributors to observed disparities and affect access to diagnostic testing for STI.','Public health systems rely heavily on laboratory medicine professionals for diagnosis and reporting of STI. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians and laboratory professionals be familiar with issues underlying disparities in STI incidence and barriers to reliable diagnostic testing. In this mini-review, we will summarize contributors to racial/ethnic disparity in STI, highlight current epidemiologic trends for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, discuss policy issues that affect laboratory and public health funding, and identify specific analytic challenges for diagnostic laboratories.','Racial and ethnic disparities in STI in the US are striking and are due to complex interactions of myriad social determinants of health. Budgetary cuts for laboratory and public health services and competition for resources during the COVID-19 pandemic are major challenges. Laboratory professionals must be aware of these underlying issues and work to maximize efforts to ensure equitable access to diagnostic STI testing for all persons, particularly those most disproportionately burdened by STI."
"Through the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine became a necessary entry point into the process of diagnosis, triage, and treatment. Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19.','Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis, and COVID test results.','Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95% CI: 0.58-0.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients.','There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of a zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use.','Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection-many of which are due to systemic racism. Evidence regarding disparities that manifest through telemedicine can be used to inform tool design and systemic efforts to promote digital health equity."
"Current evidence indicates that older racial/ethnic minorities encounter disparities in depression care. Because late-life depression is common and confers major adverse health consequences, it is imperative to reduce disparities in depression care. Thus, the primary objectives of this protocol are to: (1) quantify racial/ethnic disparities in depression treatment and (2) identify and quantify the magnitude of these disparities accountable for by a multifactorial combination of patient, provider and healthcare system factors.','Data will be derived from the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial-Depression Endpoint Prevention (VITAL-DEP) study, a late-life depression prevention ancillary study to the VITAL trial. A total of 25 871 men and women, aged 50+ and 55+ years, respectively, were randomised in a 2×2 factorial randomised trial of heart disease and cancer prevention to receive vitamin D and/or fish oil for 5 years starting from 2011. Most participants were aged 65+ years old at randomisation. Medicare claims data for over 19 000 VITAL/VITAL-DEP participants were linked to conduct our study.The major study outcomes are depression treatment (<i>antidepressant use and/or receipt of psychotherapy services</i>) and adherence to medication treatment (<i>antidepressant adherence and acceptability</i>). The National Academy of Medicine framework for studying racial disparities was leveraged to select patient-level, provider-level and healthcare system-level variables and to address their potential roles in depression care disparities. Blinder-Oaxaca regression decomposition methods will be implemented to quantify and identify correlates of racial/ethnic disparities in depression treatment and adherence.','This study received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the Partners Healthcare (PHS) IRB, protocol# 2010P001881. We plan to disseminate our results through publication of manuscripts patient engagement activities, such as study newsletters regularly sent out to VITAL participants, and presentations at scientific meetings.','NCT01696435."
"Although insurance and race-based survival disparities in colon cancer are well studied, little is known regarding how these survival disparities are impacted by type of treating facility.','This is a retrospective cohort study of 433,997 patients diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Using Cox proportional hazard analyses, we assessed overall survival (OS) as a function of race, insurance status, and treating facility, after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. We also assessed differences in OS according to race and insurance status stratified by treating facility type.','OS was significantly diminished for blacks (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.10; P < 0.001) and increased for patients of other race (primarily Asians; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.74-0.78) compared with whites. Patients with private insurance had improved OS compared with uninsured (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25-1.31; P < 0.001), Medicaid (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.33-1.38; P < 0.001) and Medicare (HR, 1.13, 95% CI, 1.12-1.15; P < 0.001) patients. Compared with patients treated at comprehensive community programs, patients treated at academic centers (ACs) had improved OS (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88; P < 0.001). When stratified by type of treating facility, racial disparities were not mitigated for patients treated at ACs compared with other facilities (P = 0.266 for interaction). At ACs, patients with Medicaid had persistent OS disparities compared with patients with private insurance (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15; P < 0.001), although these disparities were significantly diminished compared with patients treated at other facilities (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.38-1.45; P < 0.001).','Other race, private insurance, and treatment at AC were independently associated with improved OS in patients with colon cancer. Medicaid-based, but not race-based, survival disparities are reduced at ACs compared with other facilities."
"Diversifying the workforce is an important strategy to reducing health disparities. Since 2007, the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) Health Disparities Network has funded a travel scholarship to promote inclusion, professional development, and diversity among investigators interested in tobacco-related health disparities research. This study examined indicators of productivity among former scholarship recipients.Methods: Scholarship recipients between 2007 and 2014 were invited to complete a survey online. The survey assessed demographic characteristics, academic productivity, and perceived professional benefit resulting from the scholarship.Results: Of the 117 scholarships recipients, 89 (77%) responded. Respondents were 67% female and had a mean age of 37.8 years. Twenty eight percent were African American, 25% Asian American, and 17% Latino. Most respondents worked in academia (80%) and nearly three-quarters (74%) reported publishing manuscripts on tobacco-related disparities, with a mean of 3.8 (SD 4.4) disparities-related publications since receiving the scholarship. Respondents' work focused on a wide range of health disparities topics and nearly all respondents reported that the scholarship removed barriers to attending the meeting and reported professional benefit from receiving the travel scholarship. Following receipt of the SRNT travel scholarship, a diverse group of scientists demonstrated scholarly productivity, professional development, and advancement of health disparities research. Similar efforts are encouraged in other professional societies.','This study examines the productivity of early career recipients of the SRNT Health Disparities Scholarship. Results suggest that the investment in annual travel scholarships by a professional organization is an important support system for emerging scientists from diverse backgrounds. This investment may help to advance the science of health disparities and engage researchers in an area where there are critical gaps in the research workforce."
"<b>Background</b> : The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted consistent inequities in the risk of infection, severity of disease, or mortality across racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States and beyond. Although novel, SARS-CoV-2 shares commonalities in transmission dynamics with other viral respiratory pathogens where similar disparities in morbidity and mortality have been documented. However, to date, there has not been a systematic review of disparities in viral respiratory pathogens. In response, this review aims to synthesize data on racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality due to viral acute respiratory infections (ARI) other than SARS-CoV-2. In particular, this review will focus on understanding structural health and social factors outside of race and ethnicity driving these disparities in the United States. <b>Methods</b> : We will conduct a systematic review of studies published between January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2020 that capture data on racial and ethnic disparities associated with increased incidence, disease severity, risk of hospitalization and/or death in viral ARI in the United States. Data characterizing individual-, community-, and structural-level factors associated with these disparities will be abstracted to better understand the underlying structural inequities contributing to racial disparities in ARI. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines will be used with reviewers employing COVIDENCE to conduct two independent rounds of title/abstract and full text reviews for all articles. A built-in tool in COVIDENCE will be used for data abstraction. <b>Discussion</b> : Findings from this systematic review will shed light on patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in viral ARI in the United States. Leveraging these data can support predictive studies of the differential impacts of COVID-19 across the United States as well as adaptive intervention strategies mitigating structural inequities, including structural racism, driving both incidence and disparities in marginalized communities. Moreover, data emerging from this review may reignite pandemic preparedness focused on vulnerable communities given structural inequities, facilitating improved future pandemic responses to novel or endemic viral respiratory pathogens in the United States. <b>Systematic review registration</b> : PROSPERO CRD42020219771."
"Sexual minority (SM; e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual) youth are disproportionately more likely to use tobacco than non-SM youth, yet there exist several critical gaps in knowledge. This study assessed (a) the timing of SM tobacco use disparities (e.g., during adolescence or early adulthood), (b) whether disparities generalize across different tobacco products, and (c) whether disparities differ by sex.','Data were from a 6-year prospective cohort of diverse high school students from Southern California who were followed into early adulthood (9 waves, 2013-2019). SM (vs. non-SM) differences in past 6-month use were assessed for: any tobacco products, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, other products (e.g., hookah), and multiple products. Disparities were modeled longitudinally across adolescence (high school) and the transition to early adulthood (end of high school to post-high school). Differences were tested by sex.','Among females, SM disparities were evident for all outcomes during both adolescence and early adulthood; no differences were observed among males. For example, SM (vs. non-SM) females had higher odds of cigarette (aOR = 4.4 [3.0-6.5]) and e-cigarette (aOR = 1.7 [1.2-2.4]) use, averaged across adolescence. The timing of disparities varied by product. For example, cigarette use disparities emerged prior to high school and persisted through adolescence and young adulthood, while e-cigarette use disparities were present in early adolescence and young adulthood only.','Young SM females are at especially high risk for tobacco use, across various tobacco products, throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Interventions must consider differences in the timing of disparities by product type."
"Health disparity is defined as a type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic and/or environmental disadvantage. Over the past two decades, major efforts have been undertaken to mitigate health disparities and promote health equity in the United States. Within pharmacy practice, health disparities have also been identified to play a role in influencing pharmacists' practice across various clinical settings. However, well-characterized solutions to address such disparities, particularly within pharmacy practice, are lacking in the literature. Recognizing that a significant amount of work will be necessary to reduce or eliminate health disparities, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences held a webinar in June 2021 to explore pertinent issues related to this topic. During the session, participants were given the opportunity to propose and discuss innovative solutions to overcome health disparities in pharmacy practice. The goal of this perspective article is to distill the essence of the presentations and discussions from this interactive session, and to synthesize ideas for practical solutions that can be translated to practice to address this public health problem."
"The coronavirus pandemic has illuminated long-standing inequities in America's health care system and societal structure. While numerous studies have identified health care disparities within our specialty, few have progressed beyond detection. Otolaryngologists have the opportunity and the responsibility to act. Within this article, leaders from otolaryngology share their experience and perspective on health care disparities, including (1) a discussion of disparities in otolaryngology, (2) a summary of health care system design and incentives, (3) an overview of implicit bias, and (4) practical recommendations for providers to advance their awareness of health care disparities and the actions to mitigate them. While the path forward can be daunting, it should not be a deterrent. Throughout the course of this article, numerous resources are provided to support these efforts. To move ahead, our specialty needs to advance our level of understanding and develop, implement, and disseminate successful interventions toward the goal of eliminating health care disparities."
"There are disparities in surgical outcomes for patients of low socioeconomic status globally, including in countries with universal healthcare systems. There is limited data on the impact of low socioeconomic status on surgical outcomes in Australia. This study examines surgical outcomes by both self-reported unemployment and neighbourhood level socioeconomic status in Australia.','A retrospective administrative data review was conducted at a tertiary care centre over a 10-year period (2008-2018) including all adult surgical patients. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for year, age, sex and Charlson Comorbidity Index was performed.','106 197 patients underwent a surgical procedure in the decade examined. The overall adverse event rates were mortality (1.13%), total postoperative complications (10.9%), failure to rescue (0.75%) and return to theatre (4.31%). Following multivariable testing, unemployed and low socioeconomic patients had a higher risk of postoperative mortality (OR 2.06 (1.50-2.82), OR 1.37 (1.15-1.64)), all complications (OR 1.43 (1.31-1.56), OR 1.21 (1.14-1.28)), failure to rescue (OR 2.03 (1.39-2.95), OR 1.38 (1.11-1.72)) and return to theatre (OR 1.42 (1.27-1.59), OR 1.24 (1.14-1.36)) (P < 0.005 for all).','Despite universal healthcare, there are disparities in surgical adverse events for patients of low socioeconomic status in Australia. Disparities in surgical outcomes can stem from three facets: a patient's access to healthcare (the severity of disease at the time of presentation), variation in perioperative care delivery, and social determinants of health. Further work is required to pinpoint why these disparities are present and to evaluate the impact of strategies that aim to reduce disparities."
"Patient and socioeconomic factors both contribute to disparities in post-mastectomy reconstruction (PMR) rates. We sought to explore PMR patterns across the US and to determine if PMR rates were associated with Medicaid expansion.','The NCDB was used to identify women who underwent PMR between 2004-2016. The data was stratified by race, state Medicaid expansion status, and region. A multivariate model was fit to determine the association between Medicaid expansion and receipt of PMR.','In comparison to Caucasian women receiving PMR in Medicaid expansion states, African American (AA) women in Medicaid expansion states were less likely to receive PMR (OR .96 [.92-1.00] <i>P</i> < .001). Patients in the Northeast (NE) had better PMR rates vs any other region in the US, for both Caucasian and AA women (Caucasian NE ref, Caucasian-South .80 [.77-.83] vs AA NE 1.11 [1.04-1.19], AA-South (.60 [.58-.63], <i>P</i> < .001). Interestingly, AA patients residing in the NE had the highest receipt of PMR 1.11 (1.04-1.19), even higher than their Caucasian counterparts residing in the same region (ref). Rural AA women had the lowest rates of PMR vs rural Caucasian women (.40 [.28-.58] vs .79 [.73-.85], <i>P</i> < .001].','Racial disparities in PMR rates persisted despite Medicaid expansion. When stratified by region, however, AA patients in the NE had higher rates of PMR than AA women in other regions. The largest disparities were seen in AA women in the rural US. Breast cancer disparities continue to be a complex problem that was not entirely mitigated by improved insurance coverage."
"COVID-19 hospitalizations of non-institutionalized persons during the first COVID-19 wave in Connecticut disproportionately affected the elderly, communities of color, and individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES). Whether the magnitude of these disparities changed after the initial lockdown and before vaccine rollout is not well documented.','All first-time hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during July to December 2020, including patients' geocoded residential addresses, were obtained from the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Those living in congregate settings, including nursing homes, were excluded. Community-dwelling patients were assigned census tract-level poverty and crowding measures from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey by linking their geocoded addresses to census tracts. Age-adjusted incidence and relative rates were calculated across demographic and SES measures and compared with those from a similar analysis of hospitalized cases during the initial wave.','During July to December 2020, there were 5652 COVID-19 hospitalizations in community residents in Connecticut. Incidence was highest among those >85 years, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic/Latinx compared with non-Hispanic Whites {relative rate (RR) 3.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.83-3.32) and 5.9 (95% CI 5.58-6.28)}, and persons living in high poverty and high crowding census tracts. Although racial/ethnic and SES disparities during the study period were substantial, they were significantly decreased compared with the first wave of COVID-19.','The finding of persistent, if reduced, large racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations 2-7 months after the initial lockdown was relaxed and before vaccination was widely available is of concern. These disparities cause a challenge to achieving health equity and are relevant for future pandemic planning."
"Racial disparities in outcomes after orthopaedic surgery have been well-documented in the fields of arthroplasty, trauma, and spine surgery; however, little research has assessed differences in outcomes after surgery for oncologic musculoskeletal disease. If racial disparities exist in the treatment of patients with pathologic long bone fractures, then they should be identified and addressed to promote equity in patient care.','(1) How do wait times between hospital admission and operative fixation for pathologic fractures of long bones differ between Black and non-Hispanic white patients, after controlling for confounding variables using propensity score matching? (2) How does the proportion of patients with 30-day postoperative complication differ between these groups after controlling for confounding variables using propensity score matching?','Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we analyzed 828 patients who underwent fixation for pathologic fractures from 2012 to 2018. This database not only provides a large enough sample of pathologic long bone fracture patients to conduct the present study, but also it contains variables such as time from hospitalization to surgery that other national databases do not. After excluding patients with incomplete data (4% of the initial cohort), 775 patients were grouped by self-reported race as Black (12% [94]) or white (88% [681]). Propensity score matching using a 1:1 nearest-neighbor match was then used to match 94 Black patients with 94 white patients according to age, gender, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, anemia, endstage renal disease, independence in performing activities of daily living, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary disease. The primary outcome of interest was the number of days between hospital admission and operative fixation, which we assessed using a Poisson regression and report as an incidence risk ratio. The secondary outcomes were the occurrences of major 30-day postoperative adverse events (failure to wean off mechanical ventilation, cerebrovascular events, renal failure, cardiovascular events, reoperation, death), minor 30-day adverse events (reintubation, wound complications, pneumonia, and thromboembolic events), and any 30-day adverse events (defined as the pooling of all adverse events, including readmissions). These outcomes were analyzed using a bivariate analysis and logistic regression with robust estimates of variance and are reported as odds ratios. Because any results on disparities rely on rigorous control of other baseline demographics, we performed this multivariable approach to ensure we were controlling for confounding variables as much as possible.','After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as age and gender, we found that Black patients had a longer mean wait time (incidence risk ratio 1.5 [95% CI 1.1 to 2.1]; p = 0.01) than white patients. After controlling for confounding variables, Black patients also had greater odds of having any postoperative adverse event (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.1 to 3.8]; p = 0.02), including readmission (OR 3.3 [95% CI 1.5 to 7.6]; p = 0.004).','The racial disparities in pathologic long bone fracture care found in our study may be attributed to fundamental racial biases, as well as systemic socioeconomic disparities in the US healthcare system. Identifying and eliminating the racial, socioeconomic, and sociocultural biases that drive these disparities would improve care for patients with orthopaedic oncologic conditions. One possible way to reduce these disparities would be to implement standardized surgical care pathways for pathological long bone fractures across different institutions to minimize variation in important aspects of care, such as time to surgical fixation. Further insight is needed on the types of standardized care pathways and the implementation mechanisms that are most effective.','Level III, therapeutic study."
"Racial/ethnic minorities in the United States are more likely than Whites to have severe and persistent mental disorders and less likely to access mental health care. This comprehensive review evaluates studies of mental health and mental health care disparities funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to provide a benchmark for the 2015 NIMH revised strategic plan. A total of 615 articles were categorized into five pathways underlying mental health care and three pathways underlying mental health disparities. Identified studies demonstrate that socioeconomic mechanisms and demographic moderators of disparities in mental health status and treatment are well described, as are treatment options that support diverse patient needs. In contrast, there is a need for studies that focus on community- and policy-level predictors of mental health care disparities, link discrimination- and trauma-induced neurobiological pathways to disparities in mental illness, assess the cost effectiveness of disparities reduction programs, and scale up culturally adapted interventions."
"Socioeconomic status (SES) and discrimination have been implicated as social determinants of health and health disparities. Yet, very little research has been done to assess their contributing role in Black-White disparities in inflammation. Using data from the Midlife in the United States (2004-2006), we conducted Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis to quantify the extent to which three indicators of SES (i.e., education, household income, and employment status) and three forms of discrimination exposures (i.e., everyday, lifetime, and workplace discrimination) explained Black-White differences in inflammation. Education, particularly having a college degree or more, explained 16.88% of the differences between Blacks and Whites. There was no evidence that household income and employment status explained Black-White inflammation differences. Lifetime discrimination significantly explained 18.18% of Black-White difference in inflammation burden. There was no evidence that everyday and workplace discrimination explained Black-White difference in inflammation burden. Together, the predictors explained 44.16% of inflammation differences between Black and White participants. Education and lifetime exposure to discrimination may play a role in inflammation disparities. Further research is needed to examine other dimensions of SES (e.g., wealth) and discrimination (e.g., racial segregation) that are associated with health to better understand the contributions of these key social determinants of Black-White inflammation disparities."
"Despite available evidence-based interventions that decrease health disparities, these interventions are often not implemented. Northwestern Medicine's<sup>®</sup> Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program (HKTP) is a culturally and linguistically competent intervention designed to reduce disparities in living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) among Hispanics/Latinos. The HKTP was introduced in two transplant programs in 2016 to evaluate its effectiveness.','This study assessed barriers and facilitators to HKTP implementation preparation.','Interviews and group discussions were conducted with transplant stakeholders (ie administrators, nurses, physicians) during implementation preparation. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided interview design and qualitative analysis.','Forty-four stakeholders participated in 24 interviews and/or 27 group discussions. New factors, not found in previous implementation preparation research in health-care settings, emerged as facilitators and barriers to the implementation of culturally competent care. Implementation facilitators included: stakeholders' focus on a moral imperative to implement the HKTP, personal motivations related to their Hispanic heritage, and perceptions of Hispanic patients' transplant education needs. Implementation barriers included: stakeholders' perceptions that Hispanics' health insurance payer mix would negatively impact revenue, a lack of knowledge about LDKT disparities and patient data disaggregated by ethnicity/race, and a perception that the family discussion component was immoral because of the possibility of coercion.','Our study identified novel barriers and facilitators to the implementation preparation of a culturally competent care intervention. Healthcare administrators can facilitate organizations' implementation of culturally competent care interventions by understanding factors challenging care delivery processes and raising clinical team awareness of disparities in LDKT."
"Disparities in access to palliative care services for populations with social disparities have been reported in Western countries. Studies indicate that these populations tend to report higher symptom distress than other population groups. We need to further investigate how social disparities influence symptom burden to improve symptom relief in these populations.','To examine the perspectives of specialist palliative care providers concerning the relationship between social disparities and symptom burden in populations with advanced cancer.','Two sequential qualitative studies that followed a combination of interpretive and critical methodologies. The interpretive approach was outlined by van Manen's hermeneutic phenomenology while the critical component was informed by the works of Paulo Freire. Participants involved two specialist palliative care teams from a large acute care hospital and a large cancer center in Western Canada. Participants included 11 palliative care providers including registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians, and pharmacists.','Participants perceived that social conditions that might aggravate symptom burden included low income, low education, lack of social support, language barriers, and rurality. The relationship between income and symptom burden reflected diverse views. Participants identified populations prone to complex symptom burden including homeless individuals, Indigenous people, people with a history of addictions, and people with mental health or psychosocial issues.','Participants perceived that social disparities may increase symptom complexity in populations with advanced cancer. Participants did not identify ethnicity and gender as influencing symptom burden. Further research is needed to examine the interactions of social disparities, patient individuality, and symptom burden."
"Higher incidence of and risk of hospitalisation and death from Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2009 pandemic was reported in ethnic minority groups in many high-income settings including in the United Kingdom (UK). Many of these studies rely on geographical and temporal aggregation of cases and can be difficult to interpret due to the spatial and temporal factors in outbreak spread. Further, it can be challenging to distinguish between disparities in health outcomes caused by variation in transmission risk or disease severity.','We used anonymised laboratory confirmed and suspected case data, classified by ethnicity and deprivation status, to evaluate how disparities in risk between socio-economic and ethnic groups vary over the early stages of the 2009 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic in Birmingham and London, two key cities in the emergence of the UK epidemic. We evaluated the relative risk of infection in key ethnic minority groups and by national and city level deprivation rank.','We calculated higher incidence in more deprived areas and in people of South Asian ethnicity in both Birmingham and London, although the magnitude of these disparities reduced with time. The clearest disparities existed in school-aged children in Birmingham, where the most deprived fifth of the population was 2.8 times more likely to be infected than the most affluent fifth of the population.','Our analysis shows that although disparities in reported cases were present in the early phase of the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak in both Birmingham and London, they vary substantially depending on the period over which they are measured. Further, the development of disparities suggest that clustering of social groups play a key part as the outbreak appears to move from one ethnic and socio-demographic group to another. Finally, high incidence and large disparities between children indicate that they may hold an important role in driving inequalities."
"There is a growing body of evidence on racial and ethnic disparities within traumatic brain injury (TBI) care. The aim of this paper was to conduct a narrative review of the literature, demonstrating how racial and ethnic disparities manifest across the full spectrum of the TBI experience in civilian populations: injury, acute care and diagnosis, post-TBI recovery and adjustment, and long-term outcomes.','We searched five electronic databases (Scopus, APA PsychNet, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar) using the search terms traumatic brain injury, head trauma, concussion, health disparities, ethnic minority, racial minority, race ethnicity, racial ethnic, prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, rehabilitation, recovery, and outcomes. Boolean search modifiers AND, NOT, and OR were used to produce relevant results. Additional resources were included by the authors, as deemed relevant to the investigation.','Our narrative review of 39 articles elucidated numerous ways in which racial and ethnic disparities span the TBI continuum of care, including acute care and diagnosis, post-TBI recovery and adjustment, and long-term outcomes.','Understanding racial and ethnic disparities is a first step in ensuring equitable care for all individuals with TBI, including raising awareness among clinicians and guiding the development of tailored interventions for racial and ethnic minority populations."
"Treatment delays in muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) have been shown to be associated with worse outcomes. While every attempt is made to provide adequate treatment expeditiously, Black and Hispanic patients often experience delays at a higher rate than their White counterparts. This study aims to quantify the mechanisms that contribute to this disparity in treatment delay.','Retrospective analysis of clinical T-stages II-IVa MIBC patients who underwent surgical resection from 2004 to 2017 in the National Cancer Database. A causal inference mediation analysis using the counterfactual framework was implemented to estimate the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in patient and system factors explain the racial/ethnic disparities in time to treatment. Mediators included income, education, comorbidities, insurance, and hospital type.','Among 22,864 patients who met inclusion criteria, 7%, 3%, 2% were of Black, Hispanic, and Other race/ethnicity, respectively. In multivariable models, compared to White patients, Black, and Hispanic patients were associated with 26% (odds ratio = 1.26, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.42) and 29% (odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.55) increased odds of having a treatment delay relative to White patients. Mediation analyses suggested that 49% and 26% the treatment delay among Black and Hispanic patients, respectively, could be removed if an intervention equalized the distribution of academic treatment, education, and insurance status to that of White patients. Treatment at an academic hospital and education were the mediators that explained the largest portion of the racial/ethnic disparity in treatment delay.','Black and Hispanic MIBC patients experience treatment delays when compared to White patients. Intervening upon patient and system factors could reduce substantial treatment delays. Future research is needed to identify other causes of disparities in treatment delays and may help population health initiatives to address racial/ethnic disparities in clinical settings."
"Pediatric cochlear implantation (CI) is a multistep process, which exposes a healthcare system's potential weaknesses in ability to deliver timely care to deaf children. The current systematic review aims to determine the sociodemographic disparities that predict pediatric CI access and use among CI candidates and recipients across the world. We hypothesize that sociodemographic factors independently influence CI access and use within a given country.','Systematic review.','A qualitative systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases was conducted for studies investigating the association of sociodemographic factors such as race, income, or insurance status with measures of pediatric CI access, such as age at CI or CI rate.','Out of 807 unique abstracts initially retrieved, 39 papers were included in the final qualitative systematic review. Twenty-seven thousand seven hundred and fifty-one CI-candidate children (6,623 CI recipients) were studied in 14 countries, with 21 studies conducted in the United States of America, published within the years of 1993 to 2020.','Some measures of CI access, such as age at CI and rates of CI, are consistently reported in the CI disparities literature while others such as access to rehabilitation services, willingness to undergo CI, and daily CI use are rarely measured. There are persistently reported disparities in a few key measures of CI access in a few populations, while there are some populations with a paucity of data. Future studies should delineate the nuances in the mechanisms of disparities by conducting multivariable analysis of representative sample data. Laryngoscope, 132:670-686, 2022."
"Sex disparities in liver transplantation (LT) for chronic liver disease have been described. It is unclear if similar disparities exist for acute liver failure (ALF).','Adults waitlisted for LT from 2002 to 2016 with ALF were investigated using the United Network of Organ Sharing database. Clinical characteristics and causative aetiologies were compared between men and women who were waitlisted Status-1. Differences in LT, waitlist removal, and 1-year post-transplant survival were explored.','Of 8,408 patients waitlisted for LT with ALF, 41.3% of men and 63.9% of women were waitlisted Status-1 (<i>p</i> <0.001). Women had significantly higher international normalised ratio, higher frequency of grade 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy, and different aetiologies of ALF than men. On univariable analysis, women were less likely to undergo LT (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 0.90; 95% CI 0.84-0.97) and were more likely to die or be removed from the waitlist as a result of clinical deterioration (SHR 1.14; 95% CI 1.002-1.30) than men. The disparities in LT (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87-1.03) and death/clinical deterioration (SHR 1.13; 95% CI 0.99-1.29) were no longer significant on multivariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, there was no difference in 1-year post-transplant survival between men and women.','Women with ALF are more likely to be waitlisted Status-1 than men. There were no clear disparities in LT or waitlist removal. Sex differences in LT and waitlist removal were attenuated on fully adjusted models, suggesting that these disparities may in part be mitigated by Status-1 listing.','Women with acute liver failure appear to be sicker than men and more often require urgent Status-1 waitlisting. There were no sex disparities in waitlist removal because of clinical deterioration or liver transplantation. This is in contrast to chronic liver disease, where sex disparities exist. The Status-1 waitlisting that women with acute liver failure receive may in part mitigate sex disparities in liver transplantation."
"The COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest pervading U.S. cities in response to the killings of George Floyd and other Black citizens at the hands of police are historically significant. These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities. <b>DISCLOSURES:</b> No funding was received for the development of this manuscript.

"Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancer killers in our country. The effects of racial disparities on care for esophageal cancer patients are incompletely understood. Using the National Cancer Database, we investigated racial disparities in treatment and outcome of esophageal cancer patients. The National Cancer Database was queried from 2004 to 2017. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to determine racial differences in access, treatment and outcome. A total of 127,098 patients were included. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).There are racial disparities in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians have improved overall survival versus Caucasians. African Americans have the worst overall survival. Racial disparities likely affect outcome in esophageal cancer. But other factors, such as epigenetics and tumor biology, may correlate more strongly with outcome for patients with esophageal cancer."
"Little is known about the factors that contribute to racial/ethnic disparities among children with special health care needs (CSHCN).','To quantify the contributions of determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care among CSHCN in Boston, Massachusetts.','A sample of 326 Black, Latino, and white CSHCN was drawn from the Boston Survey of Children's Health, a city-wide representative sample of children. The study implemented Oaxaca-Blinder-style decomposition techniques to examine the relative contributions of health resources and child-, family-, and neighborhood-level factors to disparities in four outcomes: health status, barriers to medical care, oral health status, and utilization of preventive dental care.','White CSHCN had a greater likelihood of having very good/excellent health and oral health and were less likely to experience barriers to care than Black CSHCN. Compositional differences on predictors explained 63%, 98%, and 80% of these gradients, respectively. Group variation in household income, family structure, neighborhood support, and exposure to adverse childhood experiences accounted for significant portions of the Black-white gaps in health and access. White CSHCN were also more likely to have very good/excellent health and oral health compared to Latino CSHCN. Differences on predictors accounted for about 86% and 80% of these gaps, respectively. Household income, adverse childhood experiences, and household language emerged as significant determinants of Latino-white disparities.','Racial/ethnic health disparities among CSHCN are explained by relatively few determinants. Several of the contributing factors that emerged from the analysis and could be targeted by public health and policy interventions."
"Stroke disproportionately affects racial minorities, and the level to which stroke treatment practices differ across races is understudied. Here, we performed a systematic review of disparities in stroke treatment between racial minorities and White patients. A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed to identify studies published from January 1, 2010, to April 5, 2021 that investigated disparities in access to stroke treatment between racial minorities and White patients. A total of 30 studies were included in the systematic review. White patients were estimated to use emergency medical services at a greater rate (59.8%) than African American (55.6%), Asian (54.7%), and Hispanic patients (53.2%). A greater proportion of White patients (37.4%) were estimated to arrive within 3 hours from onset of stroke symptoms than African American (26.0%) and Hispanic (28.9%) patients. A greater proportion of White patients (2.8%) were estimated to receive tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) as compared with African American (2.3%), Hispanic (2.6%), and Asian (2.3%) patients. Rates of utilization of mechanical thrombectomy were also lower in minorities than in the White population. As shown in this review, racial disparities exist at key points along the continuum of stroke care from onset of stroke symptoms to treatment. Beyond patient level factors, these disparities may be attributed to other provider and system level factors within the health care ecosystem."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on the health of Black Americans, Latinx or Hispanic Americans, and American Indians. These disparities are deeply unjust, in part, because they are the causal result of racism at both the interpersonal and structural levels. This paper argues, however, that establishing a causal connection between racism and health disparities is not the only way to explain the injustice of these disparities. The COVID-19 health disparities are arguably unjust because health equity is a ""free-standing"" demand of justice, an obligation of reparative justice, a remedy to structural injustice, and part of dismantling pernicious racial concepts. Identifying multiple accounts of injustice may lower the evidentiary bar for our normative claims and help us to identify alternative policy pathways for ending health inequity."
"Disparities are differences in health outcomes among groups that originate from sources including historically experienced social injustice and broadly defined environmental exposures. Large health disparities exist, defined by many factors including race/ethnicity, sex, age, geography, and socioeconomic status. Studying disparities relies on measures of disease burden. Traditional measures, such as mortality, may be less applicable to neurological disorders, which often lead to substantial morbidity and lower quality of life, without necessarily causing death. Measures such as disability-adjusted life-years or healthy life expectancy may be more appropriate for assessing neurological disease and permit comparisons across diseases and communities. There are many approaches that can be used to study disparities. Analyses of population-based observational studies, patient registries, and administrative data all contribute to the understanding of disparities in humans. Animal and other experimental designs, including clinical trials, may be used to identify mechanisms and strategies to reduce disparities. All of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, understanding and mitigating disparities will require use of all of these methods. Crucially, a focus on not only improving outcomes among all individuals in society but minimizing or eliminating differences between those with better outcomes and those who have historically been disadvantaged should drive the ongoing investigations into disparities. This review is focused on epidemiological approaches to examining the depth and determinants of racial-ethnic disparities in the United States related to stroke, stroke care, and stroke outcomes."
"Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated stroke disparities across race and ethnic groups. The goal of the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study) was to evaluate race and ethnic differences in stroke within a community with 3 different race-ethnic groups. Starting as a population-based incidence and case-control study, the study evolved into a cohort study. Results from NOMAS have demonstrated differences in stroke incidence, subtypes, risk factors, and outcomes. Disparities in ideal cardiovascular health can help explain many differences in stroke incidence and call for tailored risk factor modification through innovative portals to shift more diverse subjects to ideal cardiovascular health. The results of NOMAS and multiple other studies have provided foundational data to support interventions. Conceptual models to address health disparities have called for moving from detecting disparities in disease incidence, to determining the underlying causes of disparities and developing interventions, and then to testing interventions in human populations. Further actions to address race and ethnic stroke disparities are needed including innovative risk factor interventions, stroke awareness campaigns, quality improvement programs, workforce diversification, and accelerating policy changes."
"Prostate cancer screening and diagnosis exhibit known racial and ethnic disparities. Whether these disparities persist in prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilization after elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results is poorly understood.','To assess potential racial and ethnic disparities in prostate MRI utilization following elevated PSA results.','This cohort study of 794 809 insured US men was drawn from deidentified medical claims between January 2011 and December 2017 obtained from a commercial claims database. Eligible participants were aged 40 years and older and received a single PSA result and no prior PSA screening or prostate MRI claims. Analysis was performed in January 2021.','Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between elevated PSA results and follow-up prostate MRI. For patients receiving prostate MRI, multivariable regressions were estimated for the time between PSA and subsequent prostate MRI. PSA thresholds explored included PSA levels above 2.5 ng/mL, 4 ng/mL, and 10 ng/mL. Analyses were stratified by race, ethnicity, and age.','Of 794 809 participants, 51 500 (6.5%) had PSA levels above 4 ng/mL; of these, 1524 (3.0%) underwent prostate MRI within 180 days. In this sample, mean (SD) age was 59.8 (11.3) years (range 40-89 years); 31 350 (3.9%) were Asian, 75 935 (9.6%) were Black, 107 956 (13.6%) were Hispanic, and 455 214 (57.3%) were White. Compared with White patients, Black patients with PSA levels above 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL were 24.1% (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89) and 35.0% (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.85) less likely to undergo subsequent prostate MRI, respectively. Asian patients with PSA levels higher than 4 ng/mL (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99) and Hispanic patients with PSA levels above 10 ng/mL (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99) were also less likely to undergo subsequent prostate MRI compared with White patients. Black patients between ages 65 and 74 years with PSA above 4 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL were 23.6% (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91) and 43.9% (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.91) less likely to undergo MRI, respectively. Race and ethnicity were not significantly associated with mean time between PSA and MRI.','Among men with elevated PSA results, racial and ethnic disparities were evident in subsequent prostate MRI utilization and were more pronounced at higher PSA thresholds. Further research is needed to better understand and mitigate physician decision-making biases and other potential sources of disparities in prostate cancer diagnosis and management."
"Cancer contributes substantially to the life expectancy gap between US blacks and whites, and racial cancer disparities remain stubborn to eradicate. Disparities vary geographically, suggesting that they are not inevitable.','The authors examined the relationship between housing discrimination and the size of cancer disparities across large US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). MSA-level cancer disparities were measured using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mortgage discrimination for each MSA was estimated using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act database, and MSA racial segregation was determined using US Census data. Patterns of housing discrimination and cancer disparities were mapped, and the associations between these place-based factors and cancer disparities across MSAs were measured.','Black-to-white cancer mortality disparities (rate ratios) varied geographically, ranging from 1.50 to 0.86; 88% of mortality ratios were >1, indicating higher mortality for blacks. In areas with greater mortgage discrimination, the gap between black and white cancer mortality rates was larger (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.32; P = .001). This relationship persisted in sex-specific analyses (males, r = 0.37; P < .001; females, r = 0.23; P = .02) and in models controlling for confounders. In contrast, segregation was inconsistently associated with disparities. Adjusting for incidence disparities attenuated, but did not eliminate, the correlation between mortgage discrimination and mortality disparities (r = 0.22-0.24), suggesting that cancer incidence and survival each account for part of the mortality disparity.','Mortgage discrimination is associated with larger black-to-white cancer mortality disparities. Some areas are exceptions to this trend. Examination of these exceptions and of policies related to housing discrimination may offer novel strategies for explaining and eliminating cancer disparities."
"The exponential growth in CT utilization in emergency department (ED) until 2008 raised concerns regarding cost and radiation exposure. Head CT was one of the commonest studies. This led to mitigating efforts such as appropriate use guidelines, policy and payment reforms. The impact of these efforts is not fully understood. In addition, disparities in outcomes of acute conditions presenting to the ED is well known however recent trends in imaging utilization patterns and disparities are not well understood. In this study, we describe nationwide trends and disparities associated with head CT in ED settings between 2007 and 2014.','We analyzed 2007-2017 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) with the primary goal to assess the rate and patterns of head CT imaging in ED.','There were an estimated 117 million in 2007 and 139 million ED visits in 2017. There was a 4% increase in the any CT use in 2017 compared to 2007. No significant change in head CT utilization rate was seen. The 2007 head CT rate was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.1-7.3) compared to 7.7% (95% CI: 6.8-8.6) in 2017. Trauma, Headache and Dizziness are the top three indications for head CT use in the ED respectively. On adjusted analyses, significantly higher head CT utilization was seen in elderly, (age>65 yrs) and significantly lower utilization rate was seen in Non-Hispanic Black and Medicaid patients, and patients in rural locations.','Previously reported exponential growth of CT use in ED is no longer seen. In particular, there was no significant change in ED head CT use between 2007 and 2017. Headache and Dizziness remain commonly used indications despite limited utility in most clinical scenarios, indicating continued need for appropriate use of imaging. There is significantly lower CT utilization in Non-Hispanic Black, Medicaid patients and those in rural locations, suggesting disparities in diagnostic work-up in marginalized and rural populations. This underscores the need for standardizing care regardless of race, insurance status and location."
"Despite advances in thoracic oncology research, the benefits of new discoveries are not universally experienced. A lack of representation of racial/ethnic minorities and individuals of low socioeconomic status in clinical trials and thoracic research contributes to persistent health care disparities. It is critical that improved racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity is achieved in our trials and research, if we are to attain generalizability of findings and reduction of health care disparities. Culturally tailored and community-based approaches can help improve recruitment and enrollment of marginalized groups in thoracic research, which is an essential step toward achieving health equity and advancing medical science."
"Surgical palliative care is an interdisciplinary treatment modality that aims to decrease suffering and improve the quality of life of seriously ill surgical patients. Although surgical palliative care is increasingly being found to positively impact patient quality of life, disparities in surgical palliative care remain poorly defined. While the field of medical palliative care has demonstrated certain racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic groups are at higher risks for receiving worse palliative care, there is no analogous consensus in the field of surgical palliative care. This is largely secondary to a paucity of research focus in this field. Given that the aforementioned disparities experienced by minoritized patient populations has led to significant morbidity, it is important to understand and call attention to disparities existing within the field of surgical palliative care as well. To advance the knowledge of current healthcare shortcomings and progress towards equitable surgical palliative care, this paper reviews the current state of surgical palliative care disparities evidence, details gaps in knowledge, and highlights priorities for future surgical palliative care research. The articles identified in this review noted disparate surgical palliative care access and outcomes across various racial/ethnic groups, age ranges, socioeconomic classes, hospital populations, and regions. However, evidence scarcity necessitates more robust research be performed to adequately identify at risk groups and understand the factors supporting disparity development."
"There is a scarcity of data on disparities in palliative care encounters in ischemic stroke patients. We have sought to answer these questions using the national inpatient database (NIS) data between 2002 and 2017. We aim to study gender, racial, regional, and socioeconomic disparities in palliative care encounters in ischemic stroke patients.','We have analyzed the NIS data from January 2002 to December 2017 using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), and ICD-10-CM codes. Linear regression was used for trend analysis and multiple logistic regression was used for adjusted analysis.','A total of 9,542,169 discharge encounters with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke were recorded from 2002 to 2017. Out of these 412,394 (4.3%) had a palliative care (PC) encounter. The median age for patients with a PC encounter was 81 (Interquartile range [IQR 79-88]). PC encounters have shown a rapid increase over the years (from 0.5% in 2002 to 8.3% in 2017, p < 0.01). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that African Americans (OR, 0.726 [95%CI, 0.716-0.736], p < 0.01), and Hispanics (OR, 0.738 [95%CI, 0.725-0.751]) were less likely to have a PC encounters. Females (OR, 1.18 7 [95% CI, 1.177-1.197], p < 0.01) were more likely to have PC encounters. Patients with better socio-economic status (OR, 1.034 [95%CI, 1.011-1.034], p < 0.01), having private insurance (OR, 1.562 [95%CI, 1.542-1.583], p < 0.01) and being in urban centers (OR, 1.815 [95%CI, 1.788-1.843], p < 0.01) were more likely to receive a PC encounter.','Significant racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities exist in PC encounters in ischemic stroke patients. The underlying reasons for this need to be explored further."
"Significant disparities are apparent in geographic areas and among racial/ethnic minority groups in Wisconsin. Cancer disparities are complex and multifactorial and require collaborative, multilevel efforts to reduce their impact. Our objective was to understand cancer disparities and identify opportunities to collaborate across community and research sectors to address them.','From May 2017 through October 2018, we assembled groups of community members and researchers and conducted 10 listening sessions and 29 interviews with a total of 205 participants from diverse backgrounds. Listening sessions and interviews were scheduled on the basis of participant preference and consisted of a brief review of maps illustrating the breast and lung cancer burden across Wisconsin, and a semistructured set of questions regarding causes, solutions, and opportunities. Interviews followed the same structure as listening sessions, but were conducted between a facilitator and 1 or 2 individuals. Major themes were summarized from all sessions and coded. We used the Model for Analysis of Population Health and Health Disparities to identify areas for collaboration and to highlight differences in emphasis between community participants and researchers.','Participants identified the need to address individual behavioral risks and medical mistrust and to build equitable multilevel partnerships. Communities provided insights on the impact of environment and location on cancer disparities. Researchers shared thoughts about societal poverty and policy issues, biologic responses, genetic predisposition, and the mechanistic influence of lifestyle factors on cancer incidence and mortality.','Listening sessions and interviews provided insight into contributors to cancer disparities, barriers to improving outcomes, and opportunities to improve health. The unique perspectives of each group underscored the need for multisector teams to tackle the complex issue of cancer disparities."
"Investigate black-white disparities in older adults' moves to assisted living and nursing homes and draw from the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model to test explanations for any disparities.','Data are from a nationally representative sample of older community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries from the 2015 (N = 5,212) National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). We use stepwise multinomial logistic regression to examine black-white disparities in moves out of community housing to assisted living or a nursing home over 2 years, before and after adjusting for predisposing (age, gender), enabling (income, housing tenure, Medicaid, living arrangement) and need (activities of daily living [ADL] limitation, physical capacity, self-rated health, and dementia) factors.','Black older adults are less likely to move to assisted living and are more likely to move to a nursing home compared to white older adults. Black-white disparities in moves to nursing homes are explained by black-white differences in enabling and need factors, whereas black-white disparities in moves to assisted living remain even after adjusting for enabling and need factors.','Unmeasured factors related to systemic racism (e.g., residential racial segregation, racial discrimination) and/or black-white differences in care preferences might further explain black-white disparities in moves to assisted living and warrant further investigation."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified U.S. health disparities. Though disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization by race-ethnicity are large, disparities by income and education have not been studied. Using an index based on preexisting health conditions and age, we estimate disparities in vulnerability to hospitalization from COVID-19 by income, education, and race-ethnicity for U.S. adults. The index uses estimates of health condition and age effects on hospitalization for respiratory distress prior to the pandemic validated on COVID-19 hospitalizations. We find vulnerability arising from preexisting conditions is nearly three times higher for bottom versus top income quartile adults and 60 % higher for those with a high-school degree relative to a college degree. Though non-Hispanic Blacks are more vulnerable than non-Hispanic Whites at comparable ages, among all adults the groups are equally vulnerable because non-Hispanic Blacks are younger. Hispanics are the least vulnerable. Results suggest that income and education disparities in hospitalization are likely large and should be examined directly to further understand the unequal impact of the pandemic."
"Racial disparities in sleep may be consequential among college students given high rates of dysfunctional sleep among this population. The present study sought to investigate whether disparities in sleep explain existing mental health disparities.','Data included secondary analysis of a college risk behaviors and health study (n = 1242, mean age = 18.5). Race was dichotomized as White or Black, excluding all others, with participants completing measures of sleep at baseline and measures of depression and anxiety at follow-up 1 to 2 years later.','Compared to White students, Black students were more likely to report lower rates of depression and anxiety, but poorer sleep outcomes. Mediation analyses revealed that sleep partially mediated (suppressed) the association between race and depressive and anxiety symptoms.','Results indicate that disparities in sleep may play an important role in the association between race and mental health symptoms among college students. Future health disparity research would benefit from exploring the potentially bidirectional relationship between sleep and mental health symptoms among college students."
"<b>Background:</b> Research on disparities in traumatic injury has not been well characterized, limiting understanding of gaps in research and development of successful interventions. We conducted a scoping review to identify and synthesize research on disparities in intentional and unintentional traumatic injuries. <b>Methods:</b> The review was guided by PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL and systematic reviews from 2007 to 2017 were searched. Eligible articles were peer reviewed; conducted in the United States; and reported on clearly defined physical trauma and disparity, defined by Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus criteria. One reviewer assessed article titles and a second reviewer validated the inclusion with a random sample. Abstract and full-text review by two reviewers determined final inclusion. <b>Results:</b> Of 7382 unique articles screened, 653 articles were included; inter-rater agreement was high (<i>K</i>=0.995). Studies reported on disparities in the acute hospital setting (104) or postacute/rehabilitation (86), with fewer focused on prevention (57) and policy development (6). Research methods used were quantitative (593) with 25 intervention studies, qualitative (45), qualitative/quantitative (7), and community-based participatory research (8). Age ranges of included studies were all ages (124), adults (318), pediatric/youth/adolescents (172), and older adults (40). Racial disparities were most commonly measured (439 studies); 38 created a white/nonwhite binary. Other commonly measured disparities were place of residence (122), insurance (111 studies), gender (89), age (75), and socioeconomic status measures (61). Disparities were noted in all of the categories. Studies commonly aggregated all types of traumatic injuries (129) or all types of violence (105). <b>Conclusions:</b> The extant injury literature lacks research on prevention and policy to address disparities. Many studies aggregated types of trauma and patient groups, preventing an understanding of distinctions between groups and potential interventions. Intervention and community-based research strategies were limited. Future research can better specify measurement of understudied equity categories, trauma types and intent, and racial groups."
"Public policy introduced since 2011 has supported provider adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and patient-provider messaging, primarily through financial incentives. It is unclear how disparities in patients' use of incentivized electronic health (eHealth) tools, like patient-provider messaging, have changed over time relative to disparities in use of eHealth tools that were not directly incentivized.','This study examines trends in eHealth disparities before and after the introduction of US federal financial incentives. We compare rates of patient-provider messaging, which was directly incentivized, with rates of looking for health information on the Web, which was not directly incentivized.','We used nationally representative Health Information National Trends Survey data from 2003 to 2018 (N=37,300) to describe disparities in patient-provider messaging and looking for health information on the Web. We first reported the percentage of individuals across education and racial and ethnic groups who reported using these tools in each survey year and compared changes in unadjusted disparities during preincentive (2003-2011) and postincentive (2011-2018) periods. Using multivariable linear probability models, we then examined adjusted effects of education and race and ethnicity in 3 periods-preincentive (2003-2005), early incentive (2011-2013), and postincentive (2017-2018)-controlling for sociodemographic and health factors. In the postincentive period, an additional model tested whether internet adoption, provider access, or providers' use of EMRs explained disparities.','From 2003 to 2018, overall rates of provider messaging increased from 4% to 36%. The gap in provider messaging between the highest and lowest education groups increased by 10 percentage points preincentive (P<.001) and 22 additional points postincentive (P<.001). The gap between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites increased by 3.2 points preincentive (P=.42) and 11 additional points postincentive (P=.01). Trends for blacks resembled those for Hispanics, whereas trends for Asians resembled those for non-Hispanic whites. In contrast, education-based disparities in looking for health information on the Web (which was not directly incentivized) did not significantly change in preincentive or postincentive periods, whereas racial disparities narrowed by 15 percentage points preincentive (P=.008) and did not significantly change postincentive. After adjusting for other sociodemographic and health factors, observed associations were similar to unadjusted associations, though smaller in magnitude. Including internet adoption, provider access, and providers' use of EMRs in the postincentive model attenuated, but did not eliminate, education-based disparities in provider messaging and looking for health information on the Web. Racial and ethnic disparities were no longer statistically significant in adjusted models.','Disparities in provider messaging widened over time, particularly following federal financial incentives. Meanwhile, disparities in looking for health information on the Web remained stable or narrowed. Incentives may have disproportionately benefited socioeconomically advantaged groups. Future policy could address disparities by incentivizing providers treating these populations to adopt messaging capabilities and encouraging patients' use of messaging."
"Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the South have the highest rates of HIV diagnosis in the country adding to the persistent racial disparities in HIV experienced by this population. The current HIV prevention and care landscape is heavily driven by individual-level clinical and biomedical approaches that have shown progress in reducing HIV diagnoses, but yield less than adequate results in reducing the HIV racial disparities for Black MSM in the South. In efforts to enhance focus on reducing the racial HIV disparities and more completely address the needs of Black MSM in the South, we offer insight on comprehensive approaches that can complement our current HIV prevention and care portfolio. There are five domains we discuss which include: (1) leveraging and integrating resources; (2) building upon existing program models designed to reduce disparities; (3) workforce development and cultural sensitivity; (4) social determinants of health data utilization; and 5) policy considerations. We urge public health practitioners and healthcare providers to consider and incorporate the outlined approaches to improve HIV outcomes along the continuum of care and ultimately reduce disparities in HIV affecting the quality of life of Black MSM living in the South."
"While socioeconomic disparities are among the most fundamental causes of health disparities, socioeconomic status (SES) does not impact health directly. One of the potential mediating factors that link SES and health is health literacy (HL). Yet although HL can be considered a modifiable risk factor of socioeconomic disparities in health, the relationship between SES, HL and health disparities is not well understood. This study reviewed the evidence regarding the mediating role of HL in the relationship between socioeconomic and health disparities. Medline, Cinahl, Embase, PsychInfo, Eric, Web of Science, Google, Google Scholar, Mednar, Doaj and Worldcat were used to retrieve studies that specifically addressed socioeconomic and socio-demographic factors related to low HL levels, as well as the mediating role of HL in the relationship between SES and disparities in health outcomes. Selected studies were assessed for methodological quality. Sixteen published studies were retained for inclusion and content analyzed using the constant comparison method. The review indicates that disadvantaged social and socioeconomic conditions contribute to low HL levels, whereby low SES, and particularly educational attainment, is the most important determinant of HL, and that HL mediates the relationship between SES and health status, quality of life, specific health-related outcomes, health behaviors and use of preventive services. HL can be considered as a modifiable risk factor of socioeconomic disparities in health. Enhancing the level of HL in the population or making health services more accessible to people with low HL may be a means to reach a greater equity in health."
"Breast cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy affecting women in the United States, with >245,000 cases diagnosed annually. Breast cancer mortality rates have continued to trend down in the past three decades, yet racial/ethnic disparities persist, with the worst mortality rates seen in Black women. Of note, when compared by race, this downward trend is also trailing in Black women. Survival after breast cancer is mainly driven by factors related to early detection and effective therapy. These factors can be grouped into ""biological"" such as age, genetic mutations, tumor characteristics; and ""social"" such as education, income, access to care. There have been studies attributing racial disparities solely to biological factors, and there are those attributing the disparities to social factors alone. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, a relationship between both factors as relates to racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes has been demonstrated. In this report, we review factors contributing to the increased morbidity and mortality for breast cancer in Black women and explore sociological relationships. Facing the worst poverty rates compared with other races, Black women are inevitably more likely to be uninsured, have limited access to quality education, and have fewer financial resources. The goal of this review was to elucidate the complex interplay between biological and social factors contributing to racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes. We conclude by emphasizing the need for interventions made at both local and national levels."
"Racial disparities in infant mortality have persisted, despite the overall decline in the United States' overall infant mortality rate (IMR). The overall IMR of the entire United States (5.58 per 1000 live births) population masks significant disparities by race and ethnicity: the non-Hispanic Black population experienced an IMR of 10.8 followed by people from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander populations at 9.4 and American Indians at 8.2. The non-Hispanic White and Asian populations in the United States have the lowest IMR at 4.6 and 3.6, respectively, as of 2018. A variety of factors that characterize minority populations, including experiences of racial discrimination, low income and education levels, poor residential environments, lack of medical insurance, and treatment at low-quality hospitals, demonstrate strong correlations with high infant mortality rates. Identifying, acknowledging, and addressing these disparities must be performed before engaging in strategies to mitigate them. Social determinants of health play a major role in health disparities, including in infant mortality. The study and implementation of programs to address neighborhood factors, education, healthcare access and quality, economic stability, and other personal and societal contexts will help us work towards a common goal of achieving health equity, regardless of racial/ethnic background."
"There is evidence of geographic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization risks that, if identified, could guide control efforts. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level geographic disparities and identify predictors of COVID-19 hospitalization risks in the St. Louis area.','Hospitalization data for COVID-19 and several chronic diseases were obtained from the Missouri Hospital Association. ZCTA-level data on socioeconomic and demographic factors were obtained from the American Community Survey. Geographic disparities in distribution of COVID-19 age-adjusted hospitalization risks, socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as chronic disease risks were investigated using choropleth maps. Predictors of ZCTA-level COVID-19 hospitalization risks were investigated using global negative binomial and local geographically weighted negative binomial models.','COVID-19 hospitalization risks were significantly higher in ZCTAs with high diabetes hospitalization risks (p < 0.0001), COVID-19 risks (p < 0.0001), black population (p = 0.0416), and populations with some college education (p = 0.0005). The associations between COVID-19 hospitalization risks and the first three predictors varied by geographic location.','There is evidence of geographic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization risks that are driven by differences in socioeconomic, demographic and health-related factors. The impacts of these factors vary by geographical location implying that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach may not be appropriate for management and control. Using both global and local models leads to a better understanding of geographic disparities. These findings are useful for informing health planning to identify geographic areas likely to have high numbers of individuals needing hospitalization as well as guiding vaccination efforts."
"Despite an overall reduction in lung cancer incidence and mortality rates worldwide, Blacks still have higher mortality rates compared to Whites. There are many factors that contribute to this difference. This review seeks to highlight racial disparities in treatment and the possible reasons for these disparities.','Factors attributing to racial disparities in lung cancer treatment include social determinants of health, differences in the administration of guideline-concordant therapy as well as molecular testing that is essential for most NSCLC patients. One way to circumvent disparities in lung cancer survivorship is to ensure equal representation of race in research at all levels that will provide insight on interventions that will address social determinants of health, differences in treatment patterns, molecular testing, and clinical trial involvement."
"Social disparities in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survival have been studied using national databases, statewide registries, and institution-level data. Some disparities emerge consistently, such as lower adherence to treatment guidelines and worse survival by race and socioeconomic status, whereas other disparities are less well studied. A critical appraisal of current data is essential to increasing equity in lung cancer care."
"There is increasing focus on highlighting disparities in both access to and equity of care in orthopedics and understanding the impact disparities have on patient health. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate socioeconomic-related factors affecting whether a patient undergoes total hip arthroplasty (THA) after a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.','From 2011 to 2018, patients ≥40 years of age diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis were identified in the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, a comprehensive all-payer database collecting preadjudicated claims in New York State. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/Tenth Revision codes were used to identify the initial diagnosis and subsequent THA. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of patient factors on the likelihood of undergoing THA.','Of 142,681 hip osteoarthritis diagnoses, 48.6% proceeded to THA. Compared to non-Hispanic white patients, Asian (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, P < .0001), Black (OR 0.51, P < .0001), and ""Other"" race (OR 0.54, P < .0001) had lower odds of THA. Hispanic patients (OR 0.55, P < .0001) had lower odds of surgery. Compared to commercial insurance, Medicare (OR 0.83, P < .0001), Medicaid (OR 0.49, P < .0001), Self-pay (OR 0.78, P < .0001), and workers' compensation (OR 0.71, P < .0001) had lower odds of THA. Having one or more Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 0.45, P < .0001) was associated with lower odds of THA, as was increased social deprivation (OR 0.99, P < .0001).','THA is associated with disparities among race, gender, primary insurance, and social deprivation. Additional research is necessary to identify the cause of these disparities to improve equity in patient care."
"<b>BACKGROUND.</b> The need for second visits between screening mammography and diagnostic imaging contributes to disparities in the time to breast cancer diagnosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an immediate-read screening mammography program was implemented to reduce patient visits and decrease time to diagnostic imaging. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of an immediate-read screening program with focus on disparities in same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal findings are made at screening mammography. <b>METHODS.</b> In May 2020, an immediate-read screening program was implemented whereby a dedicated breast imaging radiologist interpreted all screening mammograms in real time; patients received results before discharge; and efforts were made to perform any recommended diagnostic imaging during the visit (performed by different radiologists). Screening mammographic examinations performed from June 1, 2019, through October 31, 2019 (preimplementation period), and from June 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020 (postimplementation period), were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics were recorded from the electronic medical record. Multivariable logistic regression models incorporating patient age, race and ethnicity, language, and insurance type were estimated to identify factors associated with same-day diagnostic imaging. Screening metrics were compared between periods. <b>RESULTS.</b> A total of 8222 preimplementation and 7235 postimplementation screening examinations were included; 521 patients had abnormal screening findings before implementation, and 359 after implementation. Before implementation, 14.8% of patients underwent same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. This percentage increased to 60.7% after implementation. Before implementation, patients who identified their race as other than White had significantly lower odds than patients who identified their race as White of undergoing same-day diagnostic imaging after receiving abnormal screening results (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.86; <i>p</i> = .03). After implementation, the odds of same-day diagnostic imaging were not significantly different between patients of other races and White patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.50-1.71; <i>p</i> = .80). After implementation, there was no significant difference in race and ethnicity between patients who underwent and those who did not undergo same-day diagnostic imaging after receiving abnormal results of screening mammography (<i>p</i> > .05). The rate of abnormal interpretation was significantly lower after than it was before implementation (5.0% vs 6.3%; <i>p</i> < .001). Cancer detection rate and PPV1 (PPV based on positive findings at screening examination) were not significantly different before and after implementation (<i>p</i> > .05). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Implementation of the immediate-read screening mammography program reduced prior racial and ethnic disparities in same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> An immediate-read screening program provides a new paradigm for improved screening mammography workflow that allows more rapid diagnostic workup with reduced disparities in care."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified existing health disparities for marginalized populations in the United States (U.S.), particularly among Black Americans. Social determinants of health are powerful drivers of health outcomes that could influence COVID-19 racial disparities.','We collected data from publicly available databases on COVID-19 death rates through October 28, 2020, clinical covariates, and social determinants of health indicators at the U.S. county level. We utilized negative binomial regression to assess the association between social determinants of health and COVID-19 mortality focusing on racial disparities in mortality.','Counties with higher death rates had a higher proportion of Black residents and greater levels of adverse social determinants of health. A one percentage point increase in percent Black residents, percent uninsured adults, percent low birthweight, percent adults without high school diploma, incarceration rate, and percent households without internet in a county increased COVID-19 death rates by 0.9% (95% CI 0.5%-1.3%), 1.9% (95% CI 1.1%-2.7%), 7.6% (95% CI 4.4%-11.0%), 3.5% (95% CI 2.5%-4.5%), 5.4% (95% CI 1.3%-9.7%), and 3.4% (95% CI 2.5%-4.2%), respectively. Counties in the lowest quintile of a measure of economic privilege had an increased COVID-19 death rates of 67.5% (95% CI 35.9%-106.6%). Multivariate regression and subgroup analyses suggested that adverse social determinants of health may partially explain racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality.','This study demonstrates that social determinants of health contribute to COVID-19 mortality for Black Americans at the county level, highlighting the need for public health policies that address racial disparities in health outcomes."
"Reducing tobacco use is an important public health objective. It is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, yet inequalities remain. This study examines combined educational and racial/ethnic disparities in the United States related to cigarette smoking for the three largest racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and non-Hispanic Whites). Data included nine Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Surveys (TUS-CPS) conducted in the United States from 1992/1993-2018 for four smoking metrics: ever smoking rates, current smoking rates, consumption (cigarettes per day), and quit ratios. Across all TUS-CPS samples, there were 9.5% African Americans, 8.8% Hispanics/Latinos, and 81.8% non-Hispanic Whites who completed surveys. Findings revealed that lower educational attainment was associated with increased ever and current smoking prevalence over time across all racial/ethnic groups, and education-level disparities within each race/ethnicity widened over time. Disparities in ever and current smoking rates between the lowest and highest categories of educational attainment (less than a high school education vs. completion of college) were larger for African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites than Hispanics/Latinos. Non-Hispanic Whites had the highest cigarette consumption across all education levels over time. College graduates had the highest quit ratios for all racial/ethnic groups from 1992 to 2018, with quit ratios significantly increasing for Hispanics/Latinos and non-Hispanic Whites, but not African Americans. In conclusion, educational disparities in smoking have worsened over time, especially among African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos. Targeted tobacco control efforts could help reduce these disparities to meet public health objectives, although racial/ethnic disparities may persist regardless of educational attainment."
"Health disparities affect cancer incidence, treatment decisions, and adverse effects. Oncology providers may hold biases in the decision-making process, which can perpetuate health disparities.','The purpose of this article is to describe health disparities across treatment decisions and adverse effects, describe decision-making biases, and provide suggestions for nurses to mitigate adverse outcomes.','A scoping review of the literature was conducted.','Factors affecting health disparities stem, in part, from structural racism and decision-making biases, such as implicit bias, which occurs when individuals have unconscious negative thoughts or feelings toward a particular group. Other decision-making biases, seemingly unrelated to race, include default bias, delay discounting bias, and availability bias. Nurses and nurse navigators can mitigate health disparities by providing culturally appropriate care, assessing health literacy, providing education regarding adverse effects, serving as patient advocates, empowering patients, evaluating personal level of disease knowledge, and monitoring and managing cancer treatment adverse effects."
We examine the relationship between the rationing of health care resources and disparities in health care delivery and the specific implications for radiologic resource allocation frameworks such as the ACR Appropriateness Criteria. We explore what rationing is in this context and how it is manifested in radiology. We review how rationing has taken many forms and how rationing has influenced the development of disparities in access and outcomes within health care and specifically within the context of radiology. We describe how the relationship between rationing and health care delivery disparities manifested during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the corrective measures that were proposed to established rationing frameworks to facilitate more equitable pandemic-related resource distribution. We offer suggestions regarding how such solutions might be brought into radiologic resource allocation schemes to help mitigate disparities in radiologic care in the future.
"Guidelines recommend that all pregnant women should be offered prenatal genetic counseling, which includes discussions of aneuploidy and carrier screening. Previous studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic disparities in the completion of prenatal genetic testing, but few studies have evaluated for disparities in the offering of these tests. Prenatal genetic screening is a covered provision of Colorado Medicaid. We hypothesized that in the absence of a financial barrier, disparities in prenatal genetic counseling would be eliminated.','To evaluate disparities in prenatal genetic counseling by directly assessing if patients received counseling at the time of their first prenatal visit.','This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients presenting for their first prenatal visit at <20 weeks' gestation. Patients who completed prenatal genetic testing were classified as counseled, and the remaining patients' medical records were reviewed. Moreover, patients were divided into 2 groups based on their counseling status (yes or no), separately for aneuploidy and carrier screening.','Of 1103 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 97.2% were counseled for aneuploidy screening, whereas 73.3% were counseled on carrier screening. For aneuploidy, younger age, Black race, a relationship status of single, and presentation at a later gestational age were associated with lack of aneuploidy counseling on univariate analysis. After multivariable analysis, only maternal age (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.19) and gestational age (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.93) were statistically significantly associated with aneuploidy counseling. Treatment by a physician care team, having a comorbidity score of ≥1, and presenting at a later gestational age were associated with not receiving carrier screening counseling (univariate analysis). Multivariable analysis indicated significant associations with gestational age (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.94) and having a comorbidity (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.94).','Prenatal genetic counseling was less likely to be provided to women who present for prenatal care at a later gestational age. This finding was of concern because women who are less privileged were more likely to present to prenatal care at a later gestational age. Providing access to early prenatal care and developing specialized care pathways for women entering prenatal care in the second trimester of pregnancy could address disparities in prenatal genetic counseling."
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Prospective randomized lung screening trials suggest a greater lung cancer mortality benefit from screening women compared with men.','Do the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung screening guidelines that are based solely on age and smoking history contribute to sex disparities in eligibility, and if so, does the use of the PLCOm2012 risk prediction model that is based on 11 predictors of lung cancer reduce sex disparities?','This retrospective analysis of 883 lung cancer cases in the Chicago Race Eligibility for Screening Cohort (CREST) determined the sensitivity of USPSTF vs PLCOm2012 eligibility criteria, stratified according to sex. For comparisons vs the USPSTF 2013 and the recently published USPSTF 2021 (released March 9, 2021) eligibility criteria, the PLCOm2012 model was used with risk thresholds of ≥ 1.7%/6 years (6y) and ≥ 1.0%/6y, respectively.','The sensitivities for screening by the USPSTF 2013 were 46.7% for women and 64.6% for men (P = .003) and by the USPSTF 2021 were 56.8% and 71.8%, respectively (P = .02). In contrast, the PLCOm2012 ≥ 1.7%/6y sensitivities were 64.6% and 70.4%, and the PLCOm2012 ≥ 1.0%/6y sensitivities were 77.4% and 82.4%. The PLCOm2012 differences in sensitivity using ≥ 1.7%/6y and ≥ 1.0%/6y thresholds between women and men were nonsignificant (both, P = .07). Compared with men, women were more likely to be ineligible according to the USPSTF 2021 criteria because their smoking exposures were < 20 pack-years (22.8% vs 14.8%; OR<sub>Women vs Men</sub>, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.19-2.44; P = .002), and 27% of these ineligible women were eligible according to the PLCOm2012 ≥ 1.0%/6y criteria.','Although the USPSTF 2021 eligibility criteria are more sensitive than the USPSTF 2013 guidelines, sex disparities in eligibility remain. Adding the PLCOm2012 risk prediction model to the USPSTF guidelines would improve sensitivity and attenuate sex disparities."
"Despite unparalleled advances in perioperative medicine, surgical outcomes remain poor for racial minority patients relative to their white counterparts. Little is known about the excess costs to the health care system related to these disparities.','We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2001 and 2018. We included children younger than 18 years admitted with appendicitis who underwent an appendectomy during their hospital stay. We examined the inflation-adjusted hospital costs attributable to the racial disparities in surgical complications and perforation status, focusing on differences between non-Hispanic white patients and non-Hispanic Black patients.','We included 100 639 children who underwent appendectomy, of whom 89.9% were non-Hispanic white and 10.1% were non-Hispanic Black. Irrespective of perforation status at presentation, surgical complications were consistently higher for Black compared with white children, with no evidence of narrowing of the racial disparity gap over time. Black children consistently incurred higher hospital costs (median difference: $629 [95% confidence interval: $500-$758; <i>P</i> < .01). The total inflation-adjusted hospital costs for Black children were $518 658 984, and $59 372 044 (11.41%) represented the excess because of the racial disparities in perforation rates.','Although all patients had a progressive decline in post appendectomy complications, Black children consistently had higher rates of complications and perforation, imposing a significant economic burden. We provide an empirical economic argument for sustained efforts to reduce racial disparities in pediatric surgical outcomes, notwithstanding that eliminating these disparities is simply the right thing to do."
"The Final Rule clearly states that geography should not be a determinant of a chance of a potential candidate being transplanted. There have been multiple concerns about geographic disparities in patients in need of solid organ transplantation. Allocation policy adjustments have been designed to address these concerns, but there is little evidence that the disparities have been solved. The purpose of this review is to describe the main drivers of geographic disparities in solid organ transplantation and how allocation policy changes and other potential actions could impact these inequalities.','Geographical disparities have been reported in kidney, pancreas, liver, and lung transplantation. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network has modified organ allocation rules to underplay geography as a key determinant of a candidates' chance of receiving an organ. Thus, heart, lung, and more recently liver and Kidney Allocation Systems have incorporated broader organ sharing to reduce geographical disparities. Whether these policy adjustments will indeed eliminate geographical disparities are still unclear.','Modern allocation policy focus in patients need, regardless of geography. Innovative actions to further reduce geographical disparities are needed."
"<b>Purpose:</b> Racism is an essential factor to understand racial health disparities in infection and mortality due to COVID-19 and must be thoroughly integrated into any successful public health response. But highlighting the effect of racism generally does not go far enough toward understanding racial/ethnic health disparities or advocating for change; we must interrogate the various forms of racism in the United States, including behaviors and practices that are not recognized by many as racism. <b>Methods:</b> In this article, we explore the prevalence and demographic distribution of various forms of racism in the United States and how these diverse racial ideologies are potentially associated with racialized responses to the COVID-19 crisis. <b>Results:</b> We find that among white Americans, more than a quarter express traditional racist attitudes, whereas more than half endorse more contemporary and implicit forms of racist ideology. Each of these types of racism helps us explain profound disparities related to COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite a robust literature documenting persistent patterns of racial disparities in the United States, a focus on the role that various forms of racism play in perpetuating these disparities is absent. These distinctions are essential to realizing health equity and countering disparities in COVID-19 and other health outcomes among people of color in the United States."
"Psychological distress and physiological dysregulation represent two stress response pathways linked to poor health and are implicated in racial disparities in aging-related health outcomes among US men. Less is known about how coping relates to these stress responses. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine whether midlife and older men's coping strategies and behaviors accounted, in part, for Black-White disparities in men's psychological and physiological stress responses.','We examined racial differences in 12 coping strategies (COPE Inventory subscales, religious/spiritual coping, and behaviors such as stress eating and substance use) and their relationships with psychological distress (Negative Affect scale) and physiological dysregulation (blunted diurnal cortisol slopes) using regression models and cross-sectional data from 696 Black and White male participants aged 35-85 years in the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) II, 2004-2006.','Black men exhibited more psychological distress and physiological dysregulation than White men. Black and White men reported comparable use of most coping strategies, none of which demonstrated similar relationships with both stress responses. Coping strategies explained variations in psychological distress consistent with conventional protective-harmful categorizations. Coping accounted for racial disparities in men's psychological distress, as Black men reported using harmful strategies more often and were more susceptible to their negative effects. Neither differential use of coping strategies nor differing relationships accounted for racial disparities in physiological dysregulation.','Findings revealed complex relationships between coping and psychological and physiological stress responses and suggest the importance of differing approaches to reducing associated racial health disparities among men."
"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence is growing faster among Latino than non-Latino White youth, but ethnic disparities in self-management behaviors and HbA1c are unclear. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a key factor in T1D, which may confound or contribute to disparities in Latino pediatric T1D management. A systematic review examined whether ethnic differences in pediatric T1D outcomes occur and are independent of socioeconomic status (SES).','Latino youth displayed lower self-management and higher HbA1c in approximately half of the identified studies prior to including SES in analyses. Ethnic differences in self-management were found for objective (i.e., frequency of blood glucose checks), but not subjective measures. Ethnic differences were often eliminated when SES was statistically controlled. SES moderated some differences, suggesting complex sociocultural processes. Articles varied widely in SES measures and the analytic methods used to evaluate ethnic disparities. Pediatric Latino T1D disparities are inconsistent and at least partially dependent on the SES context. Recommendations for future research to systematically evaluate SES and Latino T1D disparities are made."
"Disparities in access to reconstructive surgery after breast cancer have been reported. We aim to evaluate demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing type of autologous breast reconstruction in Florida.','We queried the Florida Inpatient Discharge Dataset to evaluate disparities in type of autologous breast reconstructive surgery between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2017. Patients 18 years of age or older were included. Women younger than 65 years old on Medicare were excluded. Patients were categorized into three groups according to type of autologous reconstruction: latissimus dorsi pedicled flap (pedicled flap), free flap, or pedicled flap with implant (combined flap). Demographic and socioeconomic variables were evaluated. 𝜒2 and Mann-Whitney tests were used to estimate statistical significance. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to find independent associations.','Our results showed higher odds of reconstruction with free flap in Hispanic patients (odds ratio (OR), 1.66; 95% CI, 1.32-2.09; P < 0.0001) and patients with comorbidities (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.23-1.71; P < 0.0001). However, patients treated in Central and South Florida were less likely to undergo free flap than combined and pedicled flap reconstructions compared with those treated in North Florida (P < 0.05). Patients insured by Medicaid and Medicare were less likely to undergo free flap than combined or pedicled flap reconstruction compared to patients with private insurance (P < 0.05).','Our study identified that race, region, insurance, and comorbidity are factors associated with type of autologous breast reconstruction in Florida."
"We aimed to describe the gender-based disparities in burn injury patterns, care received, and mortality across national income levels.','In the WHO Global Burn Registry (GBR), we compared patient demographics, injury characteristics, care and outcomes by sex using Chi-square statistics. Logistic regression was used to identify the associations of patient sex with surgical treatment and in-hospital mortality.','Among 6431 burn patients (38 % female; 62 % male), females less frequently received surgical treatment during index hospitalization (49 % vs 56 %, p < 0.001), and more frequently died in-hospital (26 % vs 16 %, p < 0.001) than males. Odds of in in-hospital death was 2.16 (95 % CI: 1.73-2.71) times higher among females compared to males in middle-income countries.','Across national income levels, there appears to be important gender-based disparities among burn injury epidemiology, treatment received and outcomes that require redress. Multinational registries can be utilized to track and to evaluate initiatives to reduce gender disparities at national, regional and global levels."
"The aim of this article is to describe the known health disparities that exist among patients with sarcoidosis by socioeconomic status, race, and gender, review potential contributors to health disparities in sarcoidosis, investigate the intersectionality among socioeconomic status, race, and gender in sarcoidosis, and outline a research agenda to address these disparities.','Recent studies have reported the significant financial strain a diagnosis of sarcoidosis has on individuals and the disproportionate affect the strain has on low socioeconomic status individuals, Blacks, and females. Worse dyspnea, lower health-related quality of life, and higher rates of mortality and hospitalization are more common among those who are Black, female, or of low socioeconomic status.','Health disparities in sarcoidosis by socioeconomic status, race, and gender have been described for decades. In this review, we describe potential contributors to health disparities including stress and propose interventions to address disparities including creating educational programs accessible for low-income patients and caregivers, targeting medication adherence and trust in physicians and the medical system, and ensuring access to high-quality care for all patients. As clinicians and researchers, we owe it to our patients to not only describe the health disparities that exist but also stimulate to achieve improvement in sarcoidosis."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in HIV diagnosis rates remain despite the availability of effective treatment and prevention tools in the United States. In 2019, President Trump announced the ""Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America"" (EHE) initiative to reduce new HIV infections in the United States at least 75% by 2025 and at least 90% by 2030. The objective of this study was to show the potential effect of the EHE initiative on racial/ethnic disparities in HIV diagnosis rates at the national level.','We used 2017 HIV diagnoses data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National HIV Surveillance System. We developed a counterfactual scenario to determine changes in racial/ethnic disparities if the 2017 HIV diagnosis rates were reduced by 75% in the geographic regions targeted by the EHE initiative. We used 4 measures to calculate results: rate ratio, population-attributable proportion (PAP), Gini coefficient, and Index of Disparity.','The relative measures of racial/ethnic disparity decreased by 9%-21% in the EHE scenario compared with the 2017 HIV diagnoses data. The largest decrease was in the Hispanic/Latino:white rate ratio (-20.6%) and in the black:white rate ratio (-18.2%). The PAP measure decreased by 11.5%. The absolute versions of the Index of Disparity (unweighted and weighted) were approximately 50% lower in the EHE scenario than in the 2017 HIV diagnoses data.','EHE efforts could reduce but will not eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in HIV diagnosis rates. Efforts to address racial/ethnic disparities should continue, and innovative approaches, specifically those that focus on social and structural factors, should be developed and implemented for populations that are disproportionately affected by HIV in the United States."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment services have been documented. The objective of this study was to re-examine if racial/ethnic disparities in the use of treatment still exist using current data collected post-implementation of the Affordable Care Act.','Data were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Analyses were limited to adult White, Black, and Latino participants who met DSM-IV criteria for a past-year substance use disorder (n = 12,070). Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models examined the role of race/ethnicity on past-year use of (1) any substance abuse treatment services and (2) specialty treatment. Important covariates included socio-demographics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. A sub-analysis was also conducted that was limited to participants who reported having health insurance to explore the role of insurance status on treatment utilization by race/ethnicity.','Findings showed that Latinos and Blacks significantly underutilized specialty treatment relative to Whites. These relationships were statistically significant after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, problem severity, and perceived treatment need. However, when analyses were limited to only those with health insurance, Black-White disparities became non-significant, while Latino-White disparities persisted.','Findings highlight that Black-White and Latino-White disparities in the use of substance abuse treatment still persist. However, Black-White disparities may be limited to only those who are uninsured. Public health implications are discussed."
"Although racial/ethnic disparities in U.S. COVID-19 death rates are striking, focusing on COVID-19 deaths alone may underestimate the true effect of the pandemic on disparities.

Age-standardized excess deaths per 100 000 persons among Black, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Latino males and females were more than double those in White and Asian males and females. Non-COVID-19 excess deaths also disproportionately affected Black, AI/AN, and Latino persons. Compared with White males and females, non-COVID-19 excess deaths per 100 000 persons were 2 to 4 times higher in Black, AI/AN, and Latino males and females, including deaths due to diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and Alzheimer disease.

"The U.S. Black neonatal mortality rate is more than twice the White rate. This dramatic disparity can be decomposed into two components: (1) disparities due to differences in the distribution of birth weights, and (2) disparities due to differences in birth weight-specific mortality. I utilize this distinction to explore how the social context into which infants are born contributes to gaps in mortality between Black and White neonates. I analyze variation in Black-White differences in neonatal mortality across 33 states using 1995-2010 data. For each state, I calculate the contribution of differences in birth weight distribution versus differences in birth weight-specific mortality to the total disparity in mortality between White and Black neonates. Disparities are largely a product of different birth weight distributions between Black and White newborns (mirroring the pattern for the United States as a whole). However, in at least nine states, differences in birth weight-specific mortality make a notable contribution. This pattern is observed even among those from advantaged sociodemographic backgrounds and is driven by differences in mortality among very low birth weight neonates. This calls attention to inequality in medical care at birth as an importantcontributor to racial disparities in neonatal mortality."
"Health disparities continue to exist despite the call to increase education of health care practitioners. An assessment of health disparities education has not been previously studied in a national cohort.','To describe and compare the curriculum on health disparities from the perspective of program directors and perceptions of training among internal medicine residents.','This cross-sectional survey study used a survey of US internal medicine program directors, the 2015 Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine annual survey, which included questions about health disparities curriculum, and a 1-time survey of US internal medicine residents that asked questions related to their training in health disparities on the American College of Physicians 2015 Internal Medicine In-Training Examination. All internal medicine program directors who were members of Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (368 of 396 accredited programs), and internal medicine residents who took the Internal Medicine In-Training Examination were eligible. Final analysis of the merged data set was completed in 2018.','Questions were included on the annual Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine survey and the Internal Medicine In-Training Examination.','Program directors reported on presence of health disparities curriculum, educational methods, quality, barriers and challenges to curriculum, and Clinical Learning Environment Review. Residents reported whether they received training and quality of the training in health disparities.','A total of 227 program directors (response rate, 61.7%) and 22 723 residents (response rate, 87.2%) responded to the surveys. A total of 90 program directors (39.6%) reported a curriculum in health disparities, but among these, only 16 program directors (17.8%) felt quality of their education was very good or excellent. In more than half of the programs (52 programs [55.9%]), outcomes of the curriculum were not measured. After merging, the combined data set included 18 883 residents from 366 APDIM member programs with 225 program director responses. Among these, 13 251 residents (70.2%) reported some training in caring for patients at risk for health disparities. Of residents who reported receiving training, 10 494 (79.2%) rated the quality as very good or excellent.','These findings suggest that that despite the Clinical Learning Environment Review mandate and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education required competencies for training in health disparities, relatively few internal medicine programs in the US provided educational curriculum. Additionally, the existence of health disparities curricula in internal medicine training programs was not associated with resident's perception of training or its quality."
"Background Disparities in premature cardiac death (PCD) might stagnate the progress toward the reduction of PCD in the United States and worldwide. We estimated disparities across US counties in PCD rates and investigated county-level factors related to the disparities. Methods and Results We used US mortality data for cause-of-death and demographic data from death certificates and county-level characteristics data from multiple databases. PCD was defined as any death that occurred at an age between 35 and 74 years with an underlying cause of death caused by cardiac disease based on <i>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision</i> (<i>ICD-10</i>), codes. Of the 1 598 173 PCDs that occurred during 1999-2017, 60.9% were out of hospital. Although the PCD rates declined from 1999-2017, the proportion of out-of-hospital PCDs among all cardiac deaths increased from 58.3% to 61.5%. The geographic disparities in PCD rates across counties widened from 1999 (Theil index=0.10) to 2017 (Theil index=0.23), and within-state differences accounted for the majority of disparities (57.4% in 2017). The disparities in out-of-hospital PCD rates (and in-hospital PCD rates) associated with demographic composition were 36.51% (and 37.51%), socioeconomic features were 18.64% (and 18.36%), healthcare environment were 18.64% (and 13.90%), and population health status were 23.73% (and 30.23%). Conclusions Disparities in PCD rates exist across US counties, which may be related to the decelerated trend of decline in the rates among middle-aged adults. The slower declines in out-of-hospital rates warrants more precision targeting and sustained efforts to ensure progress at better levels of health (with lower PCD rates) against PCD."
"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) racial/ethnic minority individuals experience minority stress due to both their sexual identity and race/ethnicity and may be at elevated substance use risk (relative to heterosexuals) compared with their White LGB peers. We examined differences in the presence and magnitude of substance use disparities among LGB adults across race/ethnicity. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Using data on 168,560 adults (including 11,389 LGB adults) from the 2015-2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we examined disparities in cigarette smoking, heavy episodic drinking (HED), and marijuana use by race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, and other race/multiracial). Analyses compared lesbian/gay and bisexual adults, respectively, with heterosexual adults of the same gender and race/ethnicity. We also tested the magnitude of racial/ethnic minority disparities relative to the corresponding White disparity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Significant disparities in smoking, HED, and marijuana use were observed for lesbian/gay and bisexual women across nearly all racial/ethnic groups. Disparities were consistently greater in magnitude for Black and Hispanic LGB women compared with White LGB women. Few disparities were observed among men; the magnitude of observed disparities did not differ by race/ethnicity. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Disparities were most pronounced among racial/ethnic minority LGB women, which may reflect their unique experiences of discrimination at the intersection of multiple minority idenities. However, racial/ethnic minority gay and bisexual men were not at elevated risk relative to their White counterparts. Future research on substance use disparities among LGB individuals using an intersectional framework is warranted to elucidate differential minority stress processes that contribute to the observed heterogeneity across race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and gender."
"Significant race- and ethnicity-based disparities among those diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) exist and are deeply rooted in the history of many societies. The role of social determinants of racial disparities, including racism and bias, is often overlooked in cardiology. DCM incidence is higher in Black subjects; survival and other outcome measures are worse in Black patients with DCM, with fewer referrals for transplantation. DCM in Black patients is underrecognized and under-referred for effective therapies, a consequence of a complex interplay of social and socioeconomic factors. Strategies to manage social determinants of health must be multifaceted and consider changes in policy to expand access to equitable care; provision of insurance, education, and housing; and addressing racism and bias in health care workers. There is an urgent need to prioritize a social justice approach to health care and the pursuit of health equity to eliminate race and other disparities in the management of cardiovascular disease."
"Prior studies in the field of epilepsy surgical disparities have examined barriers in undergoing epilepsy surgical resections in disadvantaged populations involving trust in health providers, education level, social support, and fear of treatment. Few studies have analyzed the geographical locations of specialized epilepsy centers and their role in nationwide epilepsy surgical access and disparities.','To better visualize the locations of epilepsy level IV centers in the United States with respect to epilepsy prevalence and socioeconomic disadvantage.','We created heat maps of the United States to visualize geographical locations of level IV epilepsy centers with respect to the 2015 state-wide epilepsy prevalence and 2017 county-wide Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores, a composite measure of socioeconomic disadvantage. Univariate logistic regression was used to test for associations between the presence or absence of epilepsy centers and socioeconomic disadvantage.','We found eight states within the United States without any level IV epilepsy centers. In states with level IV centers, centers were clustered in populated and metropolitan regions. Disadvantaged counties (with increased ADI scores) were less likely to have level IV centers compared to counties that were less disadvantaged (lower ADI scores) (p < 0.00001).','Further work is required to remedy the decreased access to specialized epilepsy care due to geographical disparities, and to better understand its contribution to overall disparities affecting epilepsy surgery referrals."
"Previous studies have shown racial disparities in access to treatment and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. We sought to define racial disparities in functional outcomes among ischemic stroke patients receiving endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).','We performed a retrospective review of patients in our institution's prospectively collected stroke patient registry from 08/2015 to 06/2019 at 1 comprehensive and 2 thrombectomy-ready stroke centers. We reviewed patients aged ≥ 18 who received mechanical thrombectomy including only patients with race/ethnicity data belonging to the 3 largest race/ethnic groups: Non-Hispanic White (NHW), Non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and Hispanic (HIS). We compared baseline characteristics and performed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate differences in good functional outcome defined as 90-day modified Rankin score (90 day mRS 0-2) as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were discharge disposition, length of stay, and excellent functional outcome (90 day mRS 0-1). Results are given as OR [95% CI].','Among 666 patients that met inclusion criteria, 45% were NHW, 30% were NHB, and 19% were HIS. NHB and HIS patients were younger than NHW (average age NHB 62; HIS 64; and NHW 70; p < 0.001). Diabetes was more prevalent in NHB (32%, p = 0.02) and HIS (47%, p < 0.001) compared to NHW (23%). There were no significant racial differences in pre-morbid mRS, arrival NIHSS, tPA treatment rates. There was no difference in primary outcome by race comparing NHW to the other racial groups (OR 1.08 [0.68-1.72]) but compared to HIS patients, NHW had a higher likelihood of the secondary outcome of excellent functional outcome (aOR 2.23 [1.01-4.93]) defined as mRS 0-1.','In this study of over 600 patients treated with EVT, we did not find significant racial disparities in functional outcome except for less excellent functional outcome in HIS compared to NHW.

Male sex (STR: 0.57, p < 0.0001) and older age at diagnosis were also associated with reduced long-term survival. There was no evidence that survival disparities improved over time.','Racial disparities persist well into survivorship among AYA DLBCL survivors. Studies investigating specific factors associated with survival disparities are urgently needed to better address these disparities."
"Ensuring healthcare access is critical to maintain health and prevent illness. Studies demonstrate gender disparities in healthcare access. Less is known about how these vary with age, race/ethnicity, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We utilized cross-sectional data from 2016 to 2019 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a U.S. telephone-based survey of adults (≥18 years). Measures of difficulty accessing healthcare included absence of healthcare coverage, delay in healthcare access, absence of primary care physician, >1-year since last checkup, inability to see doctor due to cost, and cost-related medication non-adherence. We studied the association between gender and these variables using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, stratifying by age, race/ethnicity, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease status. Our population consisted of 1,737,397 individuals; 54% were older (≥45 years), 51% women, 63% non-Hispanic White, 12% non-Hispanic Black,17% Hispanic, 9% reported atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In multivariable-adjusted models, women were more likely to report delay in healthcare access: odds ratio (OR) and (95% confidence interval): 1.26 (1.11, 1.43) [p < 0.001], inability to see doctor due to cost: 1.29 (1.22, 1.36) [p < 0.001], cost-related medication non-adherence: 1.24 (1.01, 1.50) [p = 0.04]. Women were less likely to report lack of healthcare coverage: 0.71 (0.66, 0.75) [p < 0.001] and not having a primary care physician: 0.50 (0.48, 0.52) [p < 0.001]. Disparities were pronounced in younger (<45 years) and Black women. Identifying these barriers, particularly among younger women and Black women, is crucial to ensure equitable healthcare access to all individuals."
"Investigations of healthcare workers' implicit attitudes about patient characteristics and differences in delivery of healthcare due to bias are increasingly common. However, there is a gap in our understanding of nurse-specific bias and care disparities.','To identify (a) the types of available evidence, (b) key factors and relationships identified in the evidence and (c) knowledge gaps related to nurse bias (nurse attitudes or beliefs towards a patient characteristic) and nursing care disparities (healthcare disparities related specifically to nursing care).','Authors completed a scoping review using the Joanne Briggs Institute method and PRISMA-SCR checklist. Five databases were searched. After screening, 215 research reports were included and examined. Data were extracted from research reports and assessed for thematic patterns and trends across multiple characteristics.','Nurse bias and/or care disparity investigations have become increasingly common over the 38-year span of included reports. Multiple patient characteristics have been investigated, with the most common being race and/or ethnicity, gender and age. Twenty-nine of 215 studies identified a potential relationship between nurse bias regarding a characteristic and nursing care of individuals with that characteristic. Of these studies, 27 suggested the bias was associated with a negative disparate impact on nursing care. Only 12 reports included evaluating an intervention designed to reduce nurse bias or nursing care-related healthcare disparities.','Despite increasing research focus on individual bias and disparities in healthcare, the accumulated knowledge regarding nurses has not significantly advanced past a descriptive, exploratory level. Nor has there been a consistent focus on the role of nurses, who represent the largest component of the professional healthcare workforce.','National and international codes of ethics for nurses require provision of care according to individual, unique patient need, disregarding bias and incorporating patient characteristics into their plan of care."
"<b>Purpose:</b> Providers' beliefs about the causes of disparities and the entities responsible for addressing these disparities are important in designing disparity-reduction interventions aimed at providers. This secondary analysis of a larger study is aimed at evaluating perceptions of providers regarding the underlying causes of racial health care disparities and their views of who is responsible for reducing them. <b>Methods:</b> We surveyed 232 providers at 3 Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers. <b>Results:</b> Sixty-nine percent of participants believed that minority patients in the United States receive lower quality health care. Most participants (64%) attributed differences in quality of care for minority patients in the VA health care system primarily to patients' socioeconomic status, followed by patient behavior (43%) and provider behaviors (33%). In contrast, most participants believed that the VA and other health care organizations (75%) and providers (70%) bear the responsibility for reducing disparities, while less than half (45%) believed that patients were responsible. Among provider-level contributors to disparities, providers' poor communication was the most widely endorsed (48%), while differences in prescribing of medications (13%) and in provision of specialty referrals (12%) were the least endorsed. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although most providers in the study did not believe that providers contribute to disparities, they do believe that they, along with health care organizations, have the responsibility to help reduce them. Interventions might focus on directly offering providers concrete ways that they can help reduce disparities, rather than focusing on simply raising awareness about disparities and their contributions to them."
"Research shows that basic education improves population health, yet it remains unclear whether the expansion of primary education decreases health disparities. In this paper, I assess whether disparities in healthcare utilization decreased in conjunction with educational expansion among women of reproductive age in Ethiopia. Healthcare utilization rates in low-resource countries are often confounded with simultaneous developments in education and access to basic healthcare. Using decomposition of rates, I first disentangle the changes in health disparities induced by educational expansion from the overall increase in healthcare utilization. Then, I use the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to investigate the determinants of disparities in healthcare utilization and how these determinants changed over a 10-year period as primary education became more prevalent. Overall, disparities in healthcare utilization in Ethiopia decreased over time, yet the association between educational expansion and health disparities varies by region. Literacy explains much of the disparities in healthcare utilization, yet it loses significance over time as primary education becomes widespread. Economic factors remain persistent sources of disparities, and non-financial barriers such as the distance to travel and women's ability to travel alone become more significant. Heterogeneity in healthcare utilization across regions has distinct implications for how educational expansion may shift health disparities."
"Retrospective cross-sectional study.','The aim of this study was to examine whether there are racial and ethnic disparities in opioid use for back pain treatment. In addition, we examine whether physical therapy reduces opioid use.','Back pain is a common health problem that affects most adults in their lifetime. Opioid and physical therapy are commonly used to treat back pain. While evidence indicates that there are substantial disparities in the receipt of opioids by race and ethnicity in opioid use in the United States, it remains unclear whether these disparities in opioid use exist in the treatment of back pain.','Cross-sectional analysis of the 2010-2012 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey and logistic regression of a sample of about 4000 adults with back pain.','Logistic regression models showed statistically significant differences in opioids receipt by race among adult patients with back pain. Compared to White patients, Asian and Hispanic patients are less likely to be prescribed opioids. On the other hand, Black patients and patients of other race are more likely to receive an opioid prescription to treat their back pain even after accounting for socioeconomic status, health insurance status, and general health status. Additionally, patients who receive physical therapy treatment are less likely to be prescribed opioids.','These findings suggest that there are racial disparities in the use of opioids and physical therapy may reduce opioid prescription use to treat back pain. These disparities may be contributing to disparities in back pain recovery and long-term health disparities in general.','2."
"To review contemporary issues of health care disparities in headache medicine with regard to race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and geography and propose solutions for addressing these disparities.','An Internet and PubMed search was performed and literature was reviewed for key concepts underpinning disparities in headache medicine. Content was refined to areas most salient to our goal of informing the provision of equitable care in headache treatment through discussions with a group of 16 experts from a range of headache subspecialties.','Taken together, a multitude of factors, including racism, SES, insurance status, and geographical disparities, contribute to the inequities that exist within the health care system when treating headache disorders. Interventions such as improving public education, advocacy, optimizing telemedicine, engaging in community outreach to educate primary care providers, training providers in cultural sensitivity and competence and implicit bias, addressing health literacy, and developing recruitment strategies to increase representation of underserved groups within headache research are proposed as solutions to ameliorate disparities.','Neurologists have a responsibility to provide and deliver equitable care to all. It is important that disparities in the management of headache disorders are identified and addressed."
"Methods for translating evidence-based behavioral interventions into real-world settings seldom account for the special issues in reaching health disparity populations.','The objective of this article is to describe an innovative ""transcreational"" framework for designing and delivering interventions in communities to reduce health disparities. We define transcreation as the process of planning, delivering, and evaluating interventions so that they resonate with the community experiencing health disparities, while achieving intended health outcomes. The Transcreation Framework for Community-engaged Behavioral Interventions to Reduce Health Disparities comprises seven steps: 1) identify community infrastructure and engage partners; 2) specify theory; 3) identify multiple inputs for new program; 4) design intervention prototype; 5) design study, methods, and measures for community setting; 6) build community capacity for delivery; and 7) deliver transcreated intervention and evaluate implementation processes. Communities are engaged from the start and interventions are delivered by community-based interventionists and tested in community settings. The framework applies rigorous scientific methods for evaluating program effectiveness and implementation processes. It incorporates training and ongoing technical assistance to assure treatment fidelity and build community capacity.','This framework expands the types of scientific evidence used and balances fidelity to evidence and fit to the community setting. It can guide researchers and communities in developing and testing behavioral interventions to reduce health disparities that are likely to be sustained because infrastructure development is embedded in the research."
"Prior studies have reported mixed findings about the existence of racial disparities in readmission rates among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, but these studies used data from one state, focused on black-white disparities, and did not focus on patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). The objective of the study was to characterize racial and ethnic disparities in rates of 30-day rehospitalization directly from SNFs among fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage patients.','A cross-sectional study of admissions to SNFs in 2015 was conducted.','SNFs across the United States.','The sample included 1 500 334 white, 213 848 African American, and 99 781 Hispanic Medicare patients who were admitted to 13 375 SNFs.','The main outcome of interest was readmission, identified as patients sent back to any hospital directly from the SNF within 30 days of admission, as indicated on the Minimum Data Set discharge assessment.','Overall readmission rates for fee-for-service patients were 16.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 16.7%-16.8%) for whites, 18.8% (95% CI = 18.7%-19.0%) for African Americans, and 17.4% (95% CI = 17.1%-17.7%) for Hispanics. Readmission rates in Medicare Advantage were 14.7% (95% CI = 14.5%-14.8%) for whites, 16.8% (95% CI = 16.6%-17.1%) for African Americans, and 15.3% (95% CI = 14.9%-15.6%) for Hispanics. We also found that African Americans had about 1% higher readmission rates than whites, even when they received care within the same SNF. No statistically significant differences were found in the magnitude of within-SNF racial disparities in Medicare Advantage compared with Medicare fee-for-service.','We found racial disparities in readmission rates even within the same facility for both Medicare Advantage and fee-for-service beneficiaries. Intervention to reduce disparities in readmission rates, as well as more comprehensive quality measures that incorporate outcomes for Medicare Advantage enrollees, are needed.

"Black and Latinx individuals in the United States are afflicted disproportionately with kidney disease. Because of structural racism, social risk factors drive disparities in disease prevalence and result in worse outcomes among these patient groups. The impact of social and economic oppression is pervasive in physical and emotional aspects of health. In this review, we describe the history of race and ethnicity among black and Latinx individuals in the United States and discuss how these politicosocial constructs impact disparities in well-being and mental health. Lastly, we outline future research, clinical considerations, and policy considerations to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in well-being among black and Latinx individuals with kidney disease."
"Achieving health equity among disparity populations has been a national, regional, and local priority for several years. Health promotion and disease prevention behaviors play an important role in achieving health equity; the first generation of behavioral science studies in minority health and health disparities have provided important insights about the nature and distribution of risk exposure behaviors in disparity populations. Interventions have also been developed to enhance health promotion and disease prevention behaviors using behavioral counseling, tailored health communications, and interventions that are developed collaboratively with community stakeholders. Although intervention development and evaluation are components of transdisciplinary translational behavior research, discovery science is a critical first step in translational research. Consistent with this, conceptual models and frameworks of minority health and health disparities have evolved to include multilevel determinants that include basic behavioral mechanisms such as stress responses and stress reactivity that have physiological, psychological, and behavioral components that are relevant to minority health and health disparities. This report describes priorities, opportunities, and barriers to conducting transdisciplinary translational behavioral research during the next generation of minority health and health disparities research."
"Black people in the United States experience greater atopic dermatitis (AD) prevalence, severity, and persistence when compared with White people. Although very little published literature describes AD in the Latinx population, additional differences in severity, persistence, and age of onset exist in contrast to White people. Thus far, genetic polymorphisms associated with increased risk and/or severity of AD are less common among Black people, so should confer reduced, rather than the observed increased, AD risk among Black people. Little is known regarding genetic risk factors in Latinx people. In contrast, there is consistent evidence that socioeconomic, environmental, and health care factors influence AD prevalence, severity, and/or persistence, and these same risk factors are more common among racial and ethnic minority populations as a result of racism. Researchers too often pursue genetic explanations for racial and ethnic AD disparities when the evidence points to the importance of contextual, rather than genetic, causes of these disparities. Reframing the prevailing view that innate differences among racial and ethnic groups are responsible for these disparities by emphasizing the role of racism and its downstream effects on contextual factors will be a critical first step toward shrinking these disparities."
"The burden of asthma disproportionately affects minority and low-income communities, resulting in racial and socioeconomic disparities in asthma prevalence, asthma exacerbations, and asthma-related death. Social determinants of health are increasingly implicated as root causes of disparities, and healthy housing is perhaps the most critical social determinant in asthma health disparities. In many minority communities, poor housing conditions and value are a legacy of historical policies and practices imbued with structural racism, including redlining, displacement, and exclusionary zoning. As a result, poor-quality, substandard housing is a characteristic feature of many underrepresented minority communities. Consequently, structurally deficient housing stock cultivates home environments rife with indoor asthma triggers. In this review we consider the historical context of urban housing policies and practices and how these policies and practices have contributed to the substandard housing conditions for many minoritized children in the present day. We describe the impact of poor housing quality on asthma and interventions that have attempted to mitigate its influence on asthma symptoms and health care utilization. We discuss the need to promote asthma health equity by reinvesting in these neighborhoods and communities to provide healthy housing."
"Concerns exist regarding exacerbation of existing disparities in health care access with the rapid implementation of telemedicine during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, data on pre-existing disparities in telemedicine utilization is currently lacking.','We aimed to study: (1) the prevalence of outpatient telemedicine visits before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income; and (2) associated diagnosis categories.','This was a retrospective cohort study.','Commercial claims data from the Truven MarketScan database (2014-2018) representing n=846,461,609 outpatient visits.','We studied characteristics and utilization of outpatient telemedicine services before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income. Disparities were assessed in unadjusted and adjusted (regression) analyses.','With overall telemedicine uptake of 0.12% (n=1,018,092/846,461,609 outpatient visits) we found that pre-COVID-19 disparities in telemedicine use became more pronounced over time with lower use in patients who were older, had more comorbidities, were in rural areas, and had lower median household incomes (all trends and effect estimates P<0.001).','These results contextualize pre-existing disparities in telemedicine use and are crucial in the monitoring of potential disparities in telemedicine access and subsequent outcomes after the rapid expansion of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Healthcare disparities are an issue in the surgical management of orthopaedic conditions in children. Although insurance expansion efforts may mitigate racial disparities in surgical outcomes, prior studies have not examined these effects on differences in pediatric orthopaedic care. To assess for racial disparities in pediatric orthopaedic care that may persist despite insurance expansion, we performed a case-control study of the outcomes of children treated for osteomyelitis in the TRICARE system, the healthcare program of the United States Department of Defense and a model of universal insurance and healthcare access.','We asked whether (1) the rates of surgical intervention and (2) 90-day outcomes (defined as emergency department visits, readmission, and complications) were different among TRICARE-insured pediatric patients with osteomyelitis when analyzed based on black versus white race and military rank-defined socioeconomic status.','We analyzed TRICARE claims from 2005 to 2016. We identified 2906 pediatric patients, of whom 62% (1810) were white and 18% (520) were black. A surgical intervention was performed in 9% of the patients (253 of 2906 patients). The primary outcome was receipt of surgical intervention for osteomyelitis. Secondary outcomes included 90-day complications, readmissions, and returns to the emergency department. The primary predictor variables were race and sponsor rank. Military rank has been used as an indicator of socioeconomic status before and during enlistment, and enlisted service members, particularly junior enlisted service members, may be at risk of having the same medical conditions that affect civilian members of lower socioeconomic strata. Patient demographic information (age, sex, race, sponsor rank, beneficiary category [whether the patient is an insurance beneficiary from an active-duty or retired service member], and geographic region) and clinical information (prior comorbidities, environment of care [whether clinical care was provided in a civilian or military facility], treatment setting, and length of stay) were used as covariates in multivariable logistic regression analyses.','After controlling for demographic and clinical factors including age, sex, sponsor rank, beneficiary category, geographic region, Charlson comorbidity index (as a measure of baseline health), environment of care, and treatment setting (inpatient versus outpatient), we found that black children were more likely to undergo surgical interventions for osteomyelitis than white children (odds ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-2.50; p = 0.001). When stratified by environment of care, this finding persisted only in the civilian healthcare setting (OR 1.85; 95% CI, 1.26-2.74; p = 0.002). Additionally, after controlling for demographic and clinical factors, lower socioeconomic status (junior enlisted personnel) was associated with a higher likelihood of 90-day emergency department use overall (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.02-2.51; p = 0.040).','We found that for pediatric patients with osteomyelitis in the universally insured TRICARE system, many of the historically reported disparities in care were absent, suggesting these patients benefitted from improved access to healthcare. However, despite universal coverage, racial disparities persisted in the civilian care environment, suggesting that no single intervention such as universal insurance sufficiently addresses differences in racial disparities in care. Future studies can address the pervasiveness of these disparities in other patient populations and the various mechanisms through which they exert their effects, as well as potential interventions to mitigate these disparities.','Level III, prognostic study."
"As the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic spreads throughout the United States, evidence is mounting that racial and ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are bearing a disproportionate burden of illness and death. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter's integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January 1-April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African American patients had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option. Our study provides real-world evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the presentation of COVID-19."
"Rural residence is commonly thought to be a risk factor for poor cancer outcomes. However, a number of studies have reported seemingly conflicting information regarding cancer outcome disparities with respect to rural residence, with some suggesting that the disparity is not present and others providing inconsistent evidence that either urban or rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes. We suggest a simple explanation for these seeming contradictions: namely that rural cancer outcome disparities are related to factors that occur differentially at a local level, such as environmental exposures, lack of access to care or screening, and socioeconomic factors, which differ by type of cancer.','We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining ten cancers treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center from 2011 to 2018, with individuals from either rural or urban residences. We defined urban residences as those in a county with a U.S. Department of Agriculture Urban Influence Code (UIC) of 1 or 2, with all other residences defines a rural. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to create a pseudo-sample balanced for covariates deemed likely to affect the outcomes modeled with cumulative link and weighted Cox-proportional hazards models.','We found that rural residence is not a simple risk factor but rather appears to play a complex role in cancer outcome disparities. Specifically, rural residence is associated with higher stage at diagnosis and increased survival hazards for colon cancer but decreased risk for lung cancer compared to urban residence.','Many cancers are affected by unique social and environmental factors that may vary between rural and urban residents, such as access to care, diet, and lifestyle. Our results show that rurality can increase or decrease risk, depending on cancer site, which suggests the need to consider the factors connected to rurality that influence this complex pattern. Thus, we argue that such disparities must be studied at the local level to identify and design appropriate interventions to improve cancer outcomes."
"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the health-care system in the United States and has brought further light on health disparities within it. However, only a few studies have examined hospitalization risk with regard to social determinants of health.','We aimed to identify how health disparities affect hospitalization rates among patients with COVID-19.','This observational study included all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 25, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Uni- and multivariate analyses were utilized to evaluate associations between demographic data and inpatient versus outpatient status for patients with COVID-19.','Multicenter (8 hospitals), largest size health system in Southeast Michigan, a region highly impacted by the pandemic.','All outpatients and inpatients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab were included. Exclusion criteria included missing demographic data or status as a non-permanent Michigan resident.','Patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided in 2 groups: outpatients and inpatients.','We described the comparative demographics and known disparities associated with hospitalization status.','Of 30,292 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 34.01% were admitted to the hospital. White or Caucasian race was most prevalent (57.49%), and 23.35% were African-American. The most common ethnicity was non-Hispanic or Latino (70.48%). English was the primary language for the majority of patients (91.60%). Private insurance holders made up 71.11% of the sample. Within the hospitalized patients, lower socioeconomic status, African-American race and Hispanic and Latino ethnicity, non-English speaking status, and Medicare and Medicaid were more likely to be admitted to the hospital.','Several health disparities were associated with greater rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19. Addressing these inequalities from an individual to system level may improve health-care outcomes for those with health disparities and COVID-19."
"To examine (1) racial/ethnic disparities in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and overall health status among Black, Latino, and White youth during adolescence; (2) whether socioeconomic status (SES) and family contextual variables influence disparities; and (3) whether disparities are consistent from pre- to early- to mid-adolescence.','A population sample of 4823 Black (1755), Latino (1812), and White (1256) youth in three US metropolitan areas was prospectively assessed in a longitudinal survey conducted on three occasions, in 5th, 7th, and 10th grades, when youth reported their HRQOL using the PedsQL™ short-form Total, Physical and Psychosocial scales and youth and parents separately reported on youth's overall health status. Parents reported their education and household income to index SES, family structure, and use of English at home.','Based on analysis conducted separately at each grade, marked racial/ethnic disparities were observed across all measures of HRQOL and health status, favoring White and disfavoring Black, and especially Latino youth. More strongly present in 5th and 7th grade, HRQOL disparities decreased by 10th grade. Most disparities between White and Black youth disappeared when adjusting for SES. However, even after adjusting for SES, family structure, and English use, overall health status disparities disfavoring Latino youth remained across all three assessments.','Racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent HRQOL and health are substantial. These disparities appear consistent from pre- to early-adolescence but diminish for HRQOL by mid-adolescence. As disparities appear influenced by SES and other family contextual variables differently in different racial/ethnic groups, efforts to reduce health disparities in youth should address culturally specific conditions impinging on health."
"Dental care among children has increased over the past decade, and racial/ethnic disparities have narrowed for some groups. We measured changes in racial/ethnic disparities in annual dental care for children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years and conducted multivariate analysis to study factors associated with changes in disparities over time.','We used Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to obtain crude prevalence estimates of dental care use and calculated absolute disparities and changes in disparities for 3 racial/ethnic groups of children and adolescents compared with non-Hispanic white children and adolescents relative to fixed points in time (2001 and 2016). We pooled all single years of data into 3 data cycles (2001-2005, 2006-2010, and 2011-2016) and used multivariate regression to assess the relationship between dental care use and race/ethnicity, controlling for the covariates of age, sex, parents' education, household income, insurance status, and data cycle (time).','Use increased by 18% only in low-income children and adolescents. Low-income Hispanic (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94-1.02) and Asian (aPR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83-1.02) participants showed no difference in dental care use relative to non-Hispanic white participants, but non-Hispanic black participants had significantly lower use (aPR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88). Public and private insurance were associated with a doubling of use among low-income children.','We saw a modest increase in dental care use and a narrowing of disparities for some low-income children and adolescents. Use among low-income Hispanic and Asian participants ""caught up"" with use among Hispanic white participants but remained well below that of children and adolescents in families with middle and high incomes. Disparities persisted for non-Hispanic black participants at all income levels."
"It is evident that health disparities exist during the COVID-19 pandemic, a pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Underlying reasons for COVID-19 health disparities are multi-factorial. However, social determinants, including those regarding socioeconomic status, social inequalities, health behaviors, and stress, may have implications on these disparities. Exposure to one or more of these social determinants is associated with heightened inflammatory responses, particularly increases in the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as immune system dysfunction. Thus, an amplified effect during COVID-19 could occur, potentially resulting in vulnerable patients experiencing an intensified cytokine storm due to a hyperactive and dysfunctional immune response. Further understanding how social determinants play a mechanistic role in COVID-19 disparities could potentially help reduce health disparities overall and in future pandemics."
"Disparities in exposure to and density of tobacco advertising are well established; however, it is still unclear how e-cigarette and heated tobacco product (HTP) advertising vary by age, education, sex, gender identity, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status (SES), and/or urban/rural area. Through a scoping review, we sought to identify potential disparities in exposure to e-cigarette and HTP advertising and promotion across populations.','In January 2020, a systematic literature search was conducted in five databases: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The search was updated in October 2020. Articles reporting on exposure to e-cigarette and/or HTP advertising and promotion across age, education, sex, gender identity, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, SES, and/or urban/rural areas were included for full-text review (n = 25). Of those, 15 were deemed relevant for data extraction.','The majority of the studies were from the U.S. (n = 12) and cross-sectional (n = 14). Studies were published between 2014 and 2020 and focused on determining causal relationships that underlie disparities; only one study assessed HTP advertising and promotion. Exposure to e-cigarette and HTP advertising was assessed at the individual-level (e.g., recall seeing ads on television) and at the neighborhood-level (e.g., ad density at the point-of-sale). Studies addressed differences across age (n = 6), education (n = 2), sex (n = 6), gender identity and sexual orientation (n = 3), race/ethnicity (n = 11), SES (n = 5), and urban/rural (n = 2). The following populations were more likely to be exposed to e-cigarette advertising: youth, those with more than a high school diploma, males, sexual and gender minorities, Whites, and urban residents. At the neighborhood-level, e-cigarette advertisements were more prevalent in non-White neighborhoods.','Exposure to e-cigarette/HTP advertising varies based on sociodemographic characteristics, although the literature is limited especially regarding HTPs. Higher exposure among youth might increase tobacco-related disparities since it can lead to nicotine/tobacco use. Research should incorporate and apply a health equity lens from its inception to obtain data to inform the elimination of those disparities."
"Our goal was to systematically review the literature on racial/ethnic, insurance, and socioeconomic disparities in adult spine surgery in the United States and analyze potential areas for improvement.','We conducted a database search of literature published between January 1990 and July 2020 using PRISMA guidelines for all studies investigating a disparity in any aspect of adult spine surgery care analyzed based on race/ethnicity, insurance status/payer, or socioeconomic status (SES).','Of 2679 articles identified through database searching, 775 were identified for full-text independent review by 3 authors, from which a final list of 60 studies were analyzed. Forty-three studies analyzed disparities based on patient race/ethnicity, 32 based on insurance status, and 8 based on SES. Five studies assessed disparities in access to care, 15 examined surgical treatment, 35 investigated in-hospital outcomes, and 25 explored after-discharge outcomes. Minority patients were less likely to undergo surgery but more likely to receive surgery from a low-volume provider and experience postoperative complications. White and privately insured patients generally had shorter hospital length of stay, were more likely to undergo favorable/routine discharge, and had lower rates of in-hospital mortality. After discharge, white patients reported better outcomes than did black patients. Thirty-three studies (55%) reported no disparities within at least 1 examined metric.','This comprehensive systematic review underscores ongoing potential for health care disparities among adult patients in spinal surgery. We show a need for continued efforts to promote equity and cultural competency within neurologic surgery."
"While previous studies have documented racial/ethnic disparities in childhood obesity, less is known about when disparities emerge, how they evolve, and the most appropriate early childhood period for targeted interventions. We examined racial/ethnic differences in growth trajectories among US kindergarten-aged children followed from birth and identified sensitive periods at which disparities emerge.','This is a longitudinal study design using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort data. We employed random effects growth curves to model trajectories of mean BMI z-scores by race/ethnicity and sex. To visualize sensitive periods for emergence of disparities, we used locally estimated smoothing spline curves to graph the relationship between age and BMI z-score within each racial group.','Unweighted baseline sample size included ~ 7200 children. Overall, 54.6% of children were white, 23.1% Hispanic, 15.7% African-American, 3.4% Asian, 2.8% American-Indian, and 0.4% Pacific-Islander. Mean BMI z-scores for Hispanic boys and American-Indian boys and girls were already significantly higher by 24 months than their white peers and remained higher through kindergarten entry. African-American and Asian children started with significantly lower birth-weights compared to whites, but Asian girls' growth trajectory remained slow, while African-American girls experienced steeper increases in BMI z-scores and ultimately overtook their white and Asian peers over time. By kindergarten entry, disparities were present across all racial/ethnic groups.','Racial/ethnic disparities in US children's weight status and growth trajectories emerge at different ages for different racial groups, but they are generally well established by kindergarten age. Our findings indicate that interventions designed to prevent early childhood overweight/obesity should be implemented early in the life course."
"As the United States faces unparalleled challenges due to COVID-19, racial disparities in health and healthcare have once again taken center stage. If effective interventions to address racial disparities in transplantation, including those magnified by COVID-19, are to be designed and implemented at the national level, it is first critical to understand the complex mechanisms by which structural, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized racism influence the presence of racial disparities in healthcare and transplantation. Specifically, we must deeply re-evaluate how scientists and clinicians think about race in the transplant context, and we must actively shift our efforts from merely observing disparities to acknowledging and acting on racism as a root cause underlying the vast majority of these disparities. We must do better to ensure equitable access and outcomes for all transplant patients, including within the current COVID-19 pandemic. We respectfully offer this viewpoint as a call to action to every reader to join us in working together to help dismantle racist influences and advance transplant equity."
"This study explores OB/GYN providers' knowledge about published health and healthcare disparities in women's reproductive health.','We collected demographic and health disparities knowledge information from OB/GYN providers who were members of ACOG District IV using an online survey (n = 483). We examined differences across groups using statistical tests and regression analyses in a structural equation modeling approach.','Receiving disparities education was positively associated with higher self-reported disparities knowledge and disparities quiz performance (p < 0.05). African American/Black providers had higher quiz scores than their white counterparts, and providers varied in their levels of disparities knowledge across practice settings (p < 0.05).','Differences in levels of knowledge of racial/ethnic disparities in health and healthcare outcomes among OB/GYN providers varied across race/ethnicity, practice context, and whether providers had received formal disparities education. Future research should explore these differences at a population level and develop interventions to improve health disparities education among OB/GYN providers."
"Significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in breast cancer treatment and survival. However, studies characterizing these disparities among patients developing bilateral breast cancers (BBC) are lacking. The purpose of this study is to understand the association between race and ethnicity, sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, treatment, and mortality in patients with BBC--synchronous bilateral breast cancer (sBBC) or metachronous bilateral breast cancer (mBBC).','Patients diagnosed with mBBC or sBBC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program between 2010 and 2016 were examined. sBBC was defined as contralateral breast cancer <1 year after the initial cancer diagnosis, and mBBC was contralateral cancer ≥1 year. Univariable analysis examined sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment variables. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models evaluated disease-specific mortality.','Of the 11,493 patients that met inclusion criteria, 9575 (83.3%) had sBBC, and 1918 (16.7%) had mBBC. There were significant racial and ethnic differences in stage, tumor subtype, surgical management, and chemotherapy within sBBC and mBBC groups. On adjusted multivariate analysis of all BBC patients, Black race (HR 1.42; 95%CI 1.11-1.80; p<0.005; Ref White) was associated with a higher disease-specific mortality. Conversely, patients with mBBC had a 25% relative risk reduction in disease-specific mortality (HR 0.75; 95%CI 0.61-0.92; p<0.01) compared to sBBC. Subset analysis suggested Black Race modified the effect of sBBC on mortality (p<0.0001).','Among patients with BBC, there are racial and ethnic disparities in clinical characteristics, treatment, and mortality. Future studies should focus on strategies to reduce these disparities."
"Racial disparities in hospitalization rates for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions are concerning and may signal differential access to high-quality ambulatory care. Whether racial disparities are improving as a result of better ambulatory care versus artificially narrowing because of increased use of observation status is unclear. Using Medicare data for 2011-15, we sought to determine whether black-white disparities in avoidable hospitalizations were improving and evaluated the degree to which changes in observations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions may be contributing to changes in these gaps. We found that while the racial gap in avoidable hospitalizations due to such conditions has decreased, that seems to be explained by a concomitant increase in the gap of avoidable observation stays. This suggests that changes from inpatient admissions to observation status seem to be driving the reduction in racial disparities in avoidable hospitalizations, rather than changes in the ambulatory setting."
"Rural compared to urban populations in the US have increased colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence with known disparity in screening rates and mortality. We hypothesize that rural-urban disparities are different at a regional level.','We assessed screening rates according to the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System guidelines using state and city-level data for county level estimates and correlating with county CRC mortality data from the National Cancer Institute. We used multivariable modeling to examine associations between rurality, screening rates, and mortality.','Highest screening rate states had the smallest urban-rural disparities; lowest screening rate states had the largest disparities. Percent screened and urban-rural classification correlated significantly with mortality. Rural counties experienced ∼5 more deaths per 100,000 population even controlling for screening rates.','National urban-rural disparities in CRC screening mask greater state/regional disparities, not fully explaining the urban-rural mortality gap. Other factors (i.e. access to care, treatment differences) must be considered."
"Health-impeding social determinants of health-including reduced access to care-contribute to racial and socioeconomic disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Military Health System (MHS) provides an opportunity to assess a large, diverse population for CKD disparities in the context of universal health care.','Cross-sectional study.','MHS beneficiaries aged 18 to 64 years receiving care between October 1, 2015, and September 30, 2018.','Race, sponsor's rank (a proxy for socioeconomic status and social class), median household income by sponsor's zip code, and marital status.','CKD prevalence, defined by <i>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision</i> codes and/or a validated, laboratory value-based electronic phenotype.','Multivariable logistic regression compared CKD prevalence by predictors, controlling separately for confounders (age, sex, active-duty status, sponsor's service branch, and depression) and mediators (hypertension, diabetes, HIV, and body mass index).','Of 3,330,893 beneficiaries, 105,504 (3.2%) had CKD. In confounder-adjusted models, the CKD prevalence was higher in Black versus White beneficiaries (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.64-1.70), but lower in single versus married beneficiaries (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.76-0.79). The prevalence of CKD was increased among those with a lower military rank and among those with a lower median household income in a nearly dose-response fashion (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). Associations were attenuated when further adjusting for suspected mediators.','The cross-sectional design prevents causal inferences. We may have underestimated the CKD prevalence, given a lack of data for laboratory tests conducted outside the MHS and the use of a specific CKD definition. The transient nature of the MHS population may limit the accuracy of zip code-level median household income data.','Racial and socioeconomic CKD disparities exist in the MHS despite universal health care coverage. The existence of CKD disparities by rank and median household income suggests that social risks may contribute to both racial and socioeconomic disparities despite access to universal health care coverage."
"In 2019, the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS) collected sexual orientation data for the first time in Kentucky. Tobacco use behaviors and mental health status among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) youth is infrequently documented in southern states such as Kentucky. This study aimed to analyze self-reported tobacco use and mental health in youth by sexual orientation.','Cross-sectional survey.','All participants, aged 12-19, of the 2019 Kentucky YRBS that indicated a sexual orientation.','Differences in response distributions for tobacco use and mental health measures were analyzed via chi square by sexual orientation, with additional stratification by sex.','A total of n = 1996 respondents were 12.8% LGB-identified and 82.1% heterosexual-identified. No disparities between LGB and heterosexual youth were observed in tobacco-related behaviors for male students, but disparities were persistent for female students (p = .005 for ""tried tobacco before age 13""; p = .007 for ""current smoking"", p = .012 for ""ever smoked""). Mental health disparities between LGB and heterosexual youth were significant for males and females (p < .05, all mental health measures).','Findings suggest that tobacco disparities in this most recent data are narrower than in previous years; however, mental health disparities persist between LGB and heterosexual youth in Kentucky."
"Extensive research has explored disparities in access to health care between people with and without disabilities, but much less is understood about disparities and associated factors within the disabled population.','The aim of this study was to examine differences in the prevalence of unmet health-care needs by residential status (hukou status) and disability type among people with disabilities.','Our data were from the National Survey on Basic Public Service Delivery of Persons with Disabilities. The analysis sample included a nationally representative sample of 9 642 112 adults (aged 16+ years) with disabilities. Associated factors were obtained at both individual level and community level. Cross-sectional multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare unmet medical, care, rehabilitation and accessibility needs among people with different residential statuses and different types of disabilities.','The estimated prevalence of unmet medical, care, rehabilitation and accessibility needs is 15.4%, 10.2%, 45.6% and 13.7%, respectively. Rural hukou was associated with an important 13-40% increase in unmet health-care needs for people with disabilities in China. These rural-urban disparities in unmet health service needs can be partly explained by community-level factors, including access to facilities, social participation and health professionals. Disparities across the type of disability were smaller, but on average, people with multiple disabilities appeared to have the highest rates of unmet care, medical and accessibility needs, whereas those with physical disability had the highest unmet rehabilitation need.','Differences by residential status and impairment type were evident in all types of unmet health service needs. Targeted policy designs that meet the needs for justice and equality of people with disabilities are advisable. Public health and policy efforts are required to improve access to health service and meet the needs of people with disabilities, especially in rural practices and for particular disability groups."
"Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality have declined with increased screening and scientific advances in treatment. However, improvement in colorectal cancer outcomes has not been equal for all groups and disparities have persisted over time.','Data from the California Cancer Registry were used to estimate changes in 5-year colorectal cancer-specific survival over three diagnostic time periods: 1997-2002, 2003-2008, and 2009-2014. Analyses included all patients in California with colorectal cancer as a first primary malignancy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the effect of race/ethnicity, insurance status, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) on 5-year colorectal cancer-specific survival.','On the basis of a population-based sample of 197,060 colorectal cancer cases, racial/ethnic survival disparities decreased over time among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), after adjusting for demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics. For cases diagnosed 1997-2002, colorectal cancer-specific hazard rates were higher for NHB [HR, 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.19] and lower for Asians/Pacific Islanders (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96) and Hispanics (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99) compared with NHW. In 2009-2014, colorectal cancer-specific HR for NHB was not significantly different to the rate observed for NHW (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.97-1.10). There were no changes in disparities in nSES, but increasing disparities by health insurance status.','We found a decrease in survival disparities over time by race/ethnicity, but a persistence of disparities by neighborhood socioeconomic status and health insurance status.','Further investigation into the drivers for these disparities can help direct policy and practice toward health equity for all groups."
"Disparities in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) exist among racial and ethnic groups in the US. However, little is known about spatio-temporal variations in HDP disparities. We used a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach to investigate spatio-temporal variations in HDP disparities from 2005 to 2014. County-level variation was firstly examined, followed by census tract-level variation assessment in counties where high HDP disparities were observed. A significant disadvantage in HDP was revealed for African Americans in Florida overall (Odds Ratio: 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.25, 1.29), with significant spatial variations. The greatest HDP disparities between African Americans and non-African Americans occurred in North Central Florida counties (the Big Bend region of Florida), with consistent patterns from 2005 to 2014. Analyses at census tract-level further revealed significant neighborhood disparities within these counties. Findings from this study provide important information for public health agencies and policymakers to reduce HDP disparities at the population level."
"The aim of this review is to summarize the current literature on pediatric leukemia disparities with attention to not only racial and ethnic disparities, but also socioeconomic disparities. We focus on disparities in survival as well as other health-related outcomes, including end-of-life care and late effects.','While progress has been made in decreasing some disparities, most notably in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, disparities along many axes persist. Proposed etiologies include differences in the genomic alterations of the leukemia itself to differences in access to care that operate through socioeconomic status, insurance, and geographic location. As approaches to therapy become increasingly technical and complex, particular attention to the equitable distribution of these personalized therapeutic interventions is essential. Moving beyond simple descriptive studies to focus on mechanisms of existing disparities will allow for design of interventions to reduce or eliminate disparities in pediatric leukemia."
"Higher socioeconomic status (SES) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) race/ethnicity are associated with higher treatment rates and longer overall survival (OS) among US patients with stage I-II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The proportion of OS disparities mediated through treatment disparities (PM) and the proportion predicted to be eliminated (PE) if treatment disparities were eliminated are unknown.','We analyzed 2007-2015 data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) census tract-level database and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) using causal mediation analysis methods to understand the extent to which treatment disparities mediate OS disparities. In the first set of decompositions, race/ethnicity was controlled for as a covariate proximal to SES, and lower SES strata were compared with the highest SES stratum. In the second set, an intersectional perspective was taken and each SES-race/ethnicity combination was compared with highest SES-NHW patients, who had the highest treatment rates and longest OS.','The SEER and NCDB cohorts contained 16,921 patients and 44,638 patients, respectively. When race/ethnicity was controlled for, PMs ranged from 43 to 48% and PEs ranged from 46 to 50% for various lower SES strata. When separately comparing each SES-race/ethnicity combination with the highest SES-NHW patients, results were similar for lower SES-NHW patients but differed markedly for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients, for whom PMs ranged from 60 to 80% and PEs ranged from 55 to 75% for most lower SES strata.','These results suggest that efforts to reduce treatment disparities are worthwhile, particularly for NHB and Hispanic patients, and simultaneously point to the importance of non-treatment-related causal pathways."
"Retention in substance use treatment is one of the strongest predictors of improved outcomes among adolescents, making retention an important goal of treatment. We examined treatment providers' perspectives on barriers and facilitators to treatment retention among adolescents, and their views on contributors to racial/ethnic disparities in retention including ways to address disparities.','Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 providers at state-licensed detoxification, residential, and outpatient facilities serving adolescents for substance use disorders in Massachusetts. Interviews were coded by at least two independent coders.','Providers identified barriers and facilitators at the policy/systems, facility, family, and client levels. Some of the barriers included insurance limits on sessions/length of stay and low reimbursement (policy/systems), staff turnover (facility), low family engagement (family), and low internal motivation (client). Some facilitators mentioned were support from state's substance use agency (policy/systems), flexibility with meeting location (facility), family participation (family), and high internal motivation and presence of external motivators (client). Barriers that contributed to racial/ethnic disparities included lower socio-economic status, language barriers, and mistrust. Having bilingual/bicultural staff and multi-lingual materials, and facilitating transportation were identified as strategies for reducing disparities in treatment retention.','It is critical that adolescents who access substance use services remain and complete treatment and that there is equity in treatment retention. Provider perspectives in factors associated with retention can inform the development of comprehensive interventions and policies to help improve retention and reduce disparities."
"Racial disparities in health care have been extensively documented. Although race is a recognized determinant of the incidence and outcome of disease, few studies have examined the role of race in the delivery of pediatric perianesthesia care. Whereas racial differences in health outcomes may not be easy to modify, disparities in health care delivery are modifiable. The authors examined literature to determine whether racial disparities exist in the delivery of pediatric anesthesia. They explored putative contributors to disparities at the provider, patient, and systems level and propose ideas to address potential causes of disparities in the practice of pediatric anesthesia."
"Sexual and gender minorities experience disparities throughout the life course. These are especially detrimental at the end-of-life and can include disenfranchised grief, homophobia and transphobia from medical staff, and forced outing. The best healthcare training approach to ameliorate health disparities is debated. Cultural <i>competency</i> trainings for clinicians have been commonly proposed by major medical institutions and certifying bodies to ameliorate lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) health disparities. However, cultural competency trainings have limitations, including (1) false competence, (2) measurement issues, and (3) ecological fallacy (i.e., assuming individuals conform to the norms of their cultural group). The purpose of this commentary is to describe the limitations of cultural competency training and argue for healthcare systems to implement cultural <i>humility</i> trainings as a way to reduce LGBTQ health disparities at the end-of-life. The strengths of cultural humility training include focus on (1) individuals instead of their cultural groups, (2) self-reflection, and (3) active listening. While there are challenges to implementing cultural humility trainings in the health-care system, we assert that these trainings align with the aims of healthcare systems and can be an essential tool in reducing LGBTQ health disparities. We suggest practical components of successful cultural humility trainings including leadership buy-in, appropriate outcome measurements, multiple training sessions, and fostering a safe reflection space."
"The objective of this study was to report on teachers' perceptions of using health disparities content to engage high school students in urban communities over the course of a summer health disparities professional development (PD) program. Teachers participated in a three-week, 80-hour summer PD, where they received content on health disparities, met with health disparities researchers, and developed project-based learning units focused on health disparities. To under-stand teachers' perceptions of integrating health disparities content in the classroom, thematic coding was used to analyze data from focus groups collected before and after summer PD for three cohorts of high school teachers in two urban school districts (2016-2018, N=22 teachers). Findings were that: 1) Teachers showed awareness of the social challenges students face, even prior to starting a summer PD on health disparities; 2) Teachers appreciated the role of community engagement and student activism as a solution to health disparities and felt that they would be able to engage students with this material; 3) Teachers needed resources, mostly in the form of community connections, to fully integrate health disparities lessons, with community engagement infused throughout. Findings suggest that teachers are prepared to integrate information about community context in their classes and could be furthered empowered to teach about health disparities with the right community connections and engagement infrastructure."
"Thirty-day readmission penalties implemented with the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) place a larger burden on safety-net hospitals which treat a disproportionate share of racial minorities, leading to concerns that already large racial disparities in readmissions could widen.','To examine whether there were changes in Black-White disparities in 30-day readmissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), or pneumonia following the passage and implementation of HRRP, and to compare disparities across safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals.','Repeated cross-sectional analysis, stratified by safety-net status.','1,745,686 Medicare patients over 65 discharged alive from hospitals in 5 US states: NY, FL, NE, WA, and AR.','Odds ratios comparing 30-day readmission rates following an index admission for AMI, CHF, or pneumonia for Black and White patients between 2007 and 2014.','Prior to the passage of HRRP in 2010, Black and White readmission rates and disparities in readmissions were decreasing. These reductions were largest at safety-net hospitals. In 2007, Blacks had 13% higher odds of readmission if treated in safety-net hospitals, compared with 5% higher odds in 2010 (P < 0.05). These trends continued following the passage of HRRP.','Prior to HRRP, there were large reductions in Black-White disparities in readmissions at safety-net hospitals. Although HRRP tends to assess higher penalties for safety-net hospitals, improvements in readmissions have not reversed following the implementation of HRRP. In contrast, disparities continue to persist at non-safety-net hospitals which face much lower penalties."
"Trends in racial disparities in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) care have been documented from 1991 to 2008. However, it remains unknown whether numerous national and orthopaedic-specific efforts to reduce these disparities have been successful. The purpose of this study was to investigate trends in racial disparities in TJA utilization and perioperative metrics between black and white patients in the U.S. from 2006 to 2015.','The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried to identify black and white patients who underwent primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) between 2006 to 2015. Utilization rates, length of stay in the hospital (LOS), discharge disposition, and inpatient complications and mortality were trended over time. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess changes in disparities over time.','From 2006 to 2015, there were persistent white-black disparities in standardized utilization rates and LOS for both TKA and THA (p < 0.001 for all; ptrend > 0.05 for all). Moreover, there were worsening disparities in the rates of discharge to a facility (rather than home) after both TKA (white compared with black: 40.3% compared with 47.2% in 2006 and 25.7% compared with 34.2% in 2015, ptrend < 0.001) and THA (white compared with black: 42.6% compared with 41.7% in 2006 and 23.4% compared with 29.2% in 2015, ptrend < 0.001) and worsening disparities in complication rates after TKA (white compared with black: 5.1% compared 6.1% in 2006 and 3.9% compared with 6.0% in 2015, ptrend < 0.001).','There were persistent, and in many cases worsening, racial disparities in TJA utilization and perioperative care between black and white patients from 2006 to 2015 in the U.S. These results were despite national efforts to reduce racial disparities and highlight the need for continued focus on this issue. Although recent work has shown that elimination of racial disparities in TJA care is possible, the present study demonstrates that renewed efforts are still needed on a national level."
"Social determinants of health (SDOHs), including but not limited to sex, race, socioeconomic status, insurance status, and education level, play a significant role in health disparities and affect health outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine health disparities in otology within the United States and highlight areas warranting further research.','PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE.','Our search encompassed all years through January 10, 2021. All peer-reviewed primary literature of any design and publication date regarding health disparities and otology outcomes in the United States was eligible for inclusion. Eligibility assessment was performed via 3 independent investigators.','Of the 6326 unique abstracts identified, 188 studies underwent full-text review, and 52 remained in the final review. The most frequently examined otologic condition was hearing loss (36.5%), followed by cochlear implantation (28.8%) and infection/effusion (15.4%). Vertigo/dizziness (1.9%), Ménière's disease (1.9%), and tinnitus (1.9%) were the least represented otologic conditions. Comprehensive articles on multiple disparity topics were the most common (n = 18), followed by articles on race/ethnicity (n = 11) and socioeconomic status (n = 9). Language (n = 2), education (n = 2), and gender (n = 1) were the least discussed. Over 5-fold the number of articles were published between 2011 and 2020 compared to the preceding decade (42 vs 8).','This study captures the existing literature regarding health disparities and outcomes in otology. The lack of robust data suggests the need for future quality studies aimed at investigating disparities in otologic care, as well as a broader push for recording and reporting SDOHs."
"Systems of care (SOCs) were developed to increase access to and quality of care for children with emotional and behavioral difficulties and their families through the provision of coordinated, community-based, culturally competent, family-driven services. SOCs focus on wraparound care that is individualized to meet each family's needs. Previous research has illustrated significant disparities in outcomes of nonwraparound care on the basis of youths' race-ethnicity. This study aimed to fill a research gap by examining disparities in outcomes for families receiving wraparound care coordination within an SOC.','This exploratory study examined racial-ethnic disparities in outcomes observed at intake, during service provision, and at 6-month follow-up among 1,138 youths and their caregivers who participated in wraparound care coordination as part of a statewide SOC between 2016 and 2020. Analyses of variance and regression analyses were executed to investigate whether receiving services and/or the youths' racial-ethnic identity predicted differences in behavioral health outcomes and characteristics of or satisfaction with care. Caregiver-reported outcomes were assessed with the Ohio Scales for Youth, the Child Trauma Screen, and the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire.','Results revealed few racial-ethnic disparities in the characteristics and outcomes of care coordination among participants at intake or in family involvement in the wraparound process. Participants across groups reported similar and significant improvement in outcomes. However, the results indicated some disparities in satisfaction with care.','Results revealed the positive impact of care coordination on the health and well-being of youths and caregivers across racial-ethnic groups."
"To assess disparities in current (past 30 days) cigarette smoking among US adults aged ≥ 18 years during 2002-2016.','Nine indicators associated with social disadvantage were analysed from the 2002 to 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: education, annual family income, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanicity, serious psychological distress, health insurance, public assistance, and employment status. Using descriptive and multivariable analyses, we measured trends in smoking overall and within the assessed variables. We also evaluated effect of interactions on disparities and estimated the excess number of smokers attributable to disparities.','During 2002-2016, current cigarette smoking prevalence declined overall (27.5%-20.7%; p trend < 0.01), and among all subgroups except Medicare insurees and American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). Overall inequalities in cigarette smoking grew even wider or remained unchanged for several indicators during the study period. In 2016, comparing groups with the least versus the most social advantage, the single largest disparity in current smoking prevalence was seen by race/ethnicity (prevalence ratio = 5.1, AI/ANs vs Asians). Education differences alone explained 38.0% of the observed racial/ethnic disparity in smoking prevalence. Interactions were also present; compared with the population-averaged prevalence among all AI/AN individuals (34.0%), prevalence was much higher among AI/ANs with <high school diploma (53.0%), unemployed (58.0%), or with serious psychological distress (66.9%). The burden of smoking attributable to race/ethnic disparities in smoking prevalence was an estimated 27.6 million smokers.','Overall smoking inequality increased or remained unchanged because of slower declines in smoking prevalence among disadvantaged groups. Targeted interventions among high-risk groups can narrow disparities."
"To explore a 5-year comparison of disparities in intravenous t-PA (IV t-PA) use among acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients based on race, gender, age, ethnic origin, hospital status, and geographic location.','We extracted patients' demographic information and hospital characteristics for 2010 and 2014 from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS). We compared disparities in IV t-PA use among AIS patients in 2010 to that in 2014 to estimate temporal trends. Multiple logistic regression was performed to compare disparities based on demographic variables, hospital designation, and geographic location.','Overall, there was approximately a 2% increase in IV t-PA from 2010 to 2014. Blacks were 15% less likely to receive IV t-PA compared to Whites in 2014, but in 2010, there was no difference. Patients aged 62-73 had lower odds of receiving IV t-PA than age group ≤61 in both 2010 and 2014. Designated stroke centers in the Lower New York State region were associated with reduced odds of IV t-PA use in 2010 while those located in the Upper New York State region were associated with increased odds of IV t-PA use in both 2010 and 2014, compared to their respective nondesignated counterparts. Gender, ethnic origin, and insurance status were not associated with IV t-PA utilization in both 2010 and 2014.','Overall IV t-PA utilization among AIS patients increased between 2010 and 2014. However, there are evident disparities in IV t-PA use based on patient's race, age, hospital geography, and stroke designation status."
"Guided by intersectionality frameworks, researchers have documented health disparities at the intersection of multiple axes of social status and position, particularly race and ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. To advance from identifying to intervening in such intersectional health disparities, studies that examine the underlying mechanisms are required. Although much research demonstrates the negative health impacts of perceived discrimination along single axes, quantitative approaches to assessing the role of discrimination in generating intersectional health disparities remain in their infancy. Members of our team recently introduced the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI) to address this gap. The InDI comprises three measures of enacted (day-to-day and major) and anticipated discrimination. These attribution-free measures ask about experiences of mistreatment because of who you are. These measures show promise for intersectional health disparities research but require further validation across intersectional groups and languages. In addition, the proposal to remove attributions is controversial, and no direct comparison has ever been conducted.','This study aims to cognitively and psychometrically evaluate the InDI in English and Spanish and determine whether attributions should be included.','The study will draw on a preliminary validation data set and three original sequentially collected sources of data: qualitative cognitive interviews in English and Spanish with a sample purposively recruited across intersecting social status and position (gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and nativity); a Spanish quantitative survey (n=500; 250/500, 50% sexual and gender minorities); and an English quantitative survey (n=3000), with quota sampling by race and ethnicity (Black, Latino/a/x, and White), sexual or gender minority status, and gender.','The study was funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities in May 2021, and data collection began in July 2021.','The key deliverables of the study will be bilingual measures of anticipated, day-to-day, and major discrimination validated for multiple health disparity populations using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods.','PRR1-10.2196/30987."
"Health disparities in vascular surgical care have existed for decades. Persons categorized as Black undergo a nearly twofold greater risk-adjusted rate of leg amputations. Persons categorized as Black, Latinx, and women have hemodialysis initiated via autogenous fistula less often than male persons categorized as White. Persons categorized as Black, Latino, Latina, or Latinx, and women are less likely to undergo carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. New approaches are needed to address these disparities. We suggest surgeons use data to identify groups that would most benefit from medical care and then partner with community organizations or individuals to create lasting health benefits. Surgeons alone cannot rectify the structural inequalities present in American society. However, all surgeons should contribute to ensuring that all people have access to high-quality vascular surgical care."
"Social determinants greatly impact health, and evidence suggests that health disparities still exist between patient populations. The pharmacist's role in public health continues to evolve; therefore, the deliberate integration of public health into pharmacy education is essential. Pharmacy graduates must be able to recognize social determinants of health in order to help reduce disparities and inequities in access to quality care.','Cultural sensitivity training has been one of the most commonly used vehicles to educate students about health disparities. Whereas cultural sensitivity is of critical importance, it could unintentionally perpetuate the idea of culture as the sole construct to predict health outcomes. Consequently, it is important that we approach this societal problem from a public health perspective by addressing not just culture, but all other social determinants of health.','As disparities in health outcomes continue to widen for some patient groups, it is imperative for pharmacy programs to explore novel instructional approaches to teach health disparities. A paradigm shift from awareness to action and advocacy must involve educating students on the multifaceted effects of social determinants when designing interventions to help reduce health disparities."
"Identifying disparities in myocardial infarction (MI) burden and assessing its temporal changes are critical for guiding resource allocation and policies geared towards reducing/eliminating health disparities. Our objectives were to: (a) investigate the spatial distribution and clusters of MI mortality risk in Florida; and (b) assess temporal changes in geographic disparities in MI mortality risks in Florida from 2000 to 2014.','This is a retrospective ecologic study with county as the spatial unit of analysis. We obtained data for MI deaths occurring among Florida residents between 2000 and 2014 from the Florida Department of Health, and calculated county-level age-adjusted MI mortality risks and Spatial Empirical Bayesian smoothed MI mortality risks. We used Kulldorff's circular spatial scan statistics and Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics to identify spatial clusters.','There was an overall decline of 48% in MI mortality risks between 2000 and 2014. However, we found substantial, persistent disparities in MI mortality risks, with high-risk clusters occurring primarily in rural northern counties and low-risk clusters occurring exclusively in urban southern counties. MI mortality risks declined in both low- and high-risk clusters, but the latter showed more dramatic decreases during the first nine years of the study period. Consequently, the risk difference between the high- and low-risk clusters was smaller at the end than at the beginning of the study period. However, the rates of decline levelled off during the last six years of the study, and there are signs that the risks may be on an upward trend in parts of North Florida. Moreover, MI mortality risks for high-risk clusters at the end of the study period were on par with or above those for low-risk clusters at the beginning of the study period. Thus, high-risk clusters lagged behind low-risk clusters by at least 1.5 decades.','Myocardial infarction mortality risks have decreased substantially during the last 15 years, but persistent disparities in MI mortality burden still exist across Florida. Efforts to reduce these disparities will need to target prevention programs to counties in the high-risk clusters."
"Identifying the factors associated with premature stroke mortality and measuring between-county disparities may provide insight into how to reduce variations and achieve more equitable health outcomes.','To examine the between-county disparities in premature stroke mortality in the US, investigate county-level factors associated with mortality, and describe differences in mortality disparities by place of death and stroke subtype.','This retrospective cross-sectional study linked the mortality and demographic data of US counties from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database to county-level characteristics from multiple databases. The outcome measure was county-level age-adjusted stroke mortality among adults aged 25 to 64 years in 2637 US counties from 1999 to 2018. This study was conducted from April 1, 2019, to October 31, 2020. Generalized linear Poisson regressions were fitted to investigate 4 sets of factors associated with county-level mortality: demographic composition, socioeconomic status, health care and environmental features, and population health. The Theil index score was calculated to assess the mortality disparities.','Stroke mortality was measured as the number of deaths attributed to stroke in the data set. Out-of-stroke-unit death was defined as any death occurring in outpatient or emergency departments or at the pretransport location. Five stroke subtypes were included in the analysis.','Although mortality did not change substantially from 1999 to 2018 (from 12.62 to 11.81 per 100 000 population), the proportion of deaths occurring out of the stroke unit increased from 23.56% (4328 of 18 369) to 34.57% (6978 of 20 188). A large percentage of stroke of an uncertain cause was reported, with most deaths (55.20%) occurring out of the stroke unit. In the county with the highest premature stroke mortality, the incidence was 20.78 times as high as that in the county with the lowest mortality (65.04 vs 3.13 deaths per 100 000 population). The highest between-county disparities were found for stroke of uncertain cause. For out-of-stroke-unit death, county-level mortality was largely associated with demographic composition (31.6%) and health care and environmental features (25.8%). For in-hospital death, 29.8% of county-level mortality was associated with population health and 28.7% was associated with demographic composition.','These findings suggest that strategies addressing specific factors that underlie the mortality disparities among US counties, especially for out-of-stroke-unit death and stroke of uncertain cause, may be useful when tailored to the county-level context before implementing interventions for the neediest counties."
"Significant racial and ethnic disparities in statin prescribing and utilization have been constantly documented.','To examine whether racial/ethnic disparities in statin treatment have decreased among the diabetic population after the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.','This retrospective study analyzed patients with diabetes aged 40-75 years old in the Medicare Expenditure Panel Survey (2011-2012 and 2014-2015). Racial and ethnic disparities in the likelihood of statin use and number of statin prescriptions were compared before and after the guideline release. Logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to adjust for patient characteristics. A difference-in-difference model (DID) was used to examine disparity changes.','This study included 2584 patients from 2011 to 2012 and 2610 from 2014 to 2015. During 2011-2012, racial/ethnic disparities were significant for the likelihood of statin use. For the number of statin prescriptions, racial disparity was significant, but not for the ethnic disparity. During 2014-2015, racial/ethnic disparities were significant for the likelihood of statin use but were not significant for the number of statin prescriptions. The DID model found that the 2013 guidelines were not associated with a reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in statin treatment.','This study found persistent disparities in the likelihood of statin use. The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines were not associated with a reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in statin treatment."
"Racial disparities have been observed in the impacts of COVID-19 in the USA. In the present paper, we used a representative sample of adults in Michigan to examine differences in COVID-19 impacts on Blacks and Whites in four domains: direct, perceived, political, and behavioral. We found that in the initial wave of the outbreak in May 2020, Blacks experienced more severe direct impacts: they were more likely to be diagnosed or know someone who was diagnosed, and more likely to lose their job compared to Whites. In addition, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19's threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19's spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks. Continued investigation of racial disparities in COVID-19's impact is necessary; however, these preliminary findings of a race-by-ideology interaction are important because they suggest some racial disparities are restricted to conservatives, while more liberal Whites and Blacks exhibit few differences."
"To answer the research question inquiring which determinants lead to health disparities among African American Men with Prostate Cancer and what factors influence clinical decision making by oncologists when delivering prostate cancer interventions in order to improve morbidity and mortality.','Primary and secondary sources were extracted from articles located using Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Terms included in the literature search were ""African American men,"" ""prostate cancer,"" ""determinants,"" ""disparities,"" and ""interventions."" Focusing on these specific terms helped narrow the scope of this systematic review by indicating which studies met the inclusion criteria. Only 20 articles were included in this systematic review. Specific inclusion criteria for this review were: 1) a publication date between 2013 and the current year; 2) a focus on African American men diagnosed with prostate cancer; 3), randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and; 4) evidence-based interventions used by oncologists.','The articles included when this systematic review provide evidence that oncologists will need to play more central roles in preventing premature death when African American men who present a higher risk of prostate cancer compared to their White and Hispanic/Latino counterparts. Shared decision-making in screening and diagnosis is also essential to close health disparities as well as improve population-level health outcomes.','The systematic review argues that oncologists will need to integrate population-based interventions capable of presenting strong empirical evidence about which determinants contribute to health disparities among African American men diagnosed with prostate cancer."
"Previous literature reported racial/ethnic disparities in the measure assessment of diabetes medication adherence in the Medicare Part D Star Ratings program.','This study examined the likelihood of inclusion in measure calculation across racial/ethnic groups for adherence metrics in Part D Star Ratings among individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia.','This was a retrospective cross sectional analysis of a 10% random sample of 2017 Medicare claims linked to Area Health Resources Files. Inclusion in measure calculation was determined based on inclusion/exclusion criteria in adherence metrics for adherence medications for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in Part D Star Ratings developed by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. Logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to adjust for patient/community characteristics.','The study sample size was 2 707 216. Compared to Non-Hispanic White (White) beneficiaries, minorities were more likely to be excluded from measure calculation among individuals with 1 condition. For example, among individuals with hypertension, compared to White individuals, the adjusted odds ratios for exclusion for Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander and other individuals were 1.46 (95% confidence interval, or CI = 1.42-1.50), 1.38 (95% CI = 1.33-1.43), 1.28 (95% CI = 1.21-1.35), and 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15), respectively. Among individuals with more than 1 chronic condition, minorities were more likely to be included in fewer calculations for medication adherence measures. For example, among individuals with all 3 conditions, the adjusted relative risk ratios for Black, compared to White, beneficiaries for being included in 0, 1, and 2 measures, versus all 3 measures, were 2.14 (95% CI = 1.99-2.30), 1.49 (95% CI = 1.41-1.56), 1.20 (95% CI = 1.18-1.23), respectively.','Compared to White beneficiaries, racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to be excluded from the calculation for adherence measures among individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia. Future studies should examine whether such disparities exacerbate existing racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes and devise solutions for these disparities."
"A long line of studies document substantial and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the use of mental health services. Many recent studies follow the Institute of Medicine's definition of disparities, adjusting only for differences in health and mental health status across groups. However, controlling for mental health may mask important changes in the magnitudes of disparities at different levels of mental health need. We extend the previous literature by explicitly estimating how differences in treatment use across groups change at different levels of psychological distress. We used detailed data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance coverage, treatment, and the K6 psychological distress scale from the 2010 to 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to estimate nonlinear models of ambulatory and prescription drug mental health treatment. We find that in contrast to physical health treatment, Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in any mental health treatment use widen with higher levels of psychological distress."
"Research reveals racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in autism diagnosis; there is limited information on potential disparities related to other dimensions of services.','We reviewed evidence related to disparities in service use, intervention effectiveness, and quality of care provided to children with autism by race, ethnicity, and/or socioeconomic status.','Medline, PsychInfo, Educational Resources Informational Clearinghouse, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched by using a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords related to autism, disparities, treatment, and services.','Included studies addressed at least one key question and met eligibility criteria.','Two authors reviewed the titles and abstracts of articles and reviewed the full text of potentially relevant articles. Authors extracted information from articles that were deemed appropriate.','Treatment disparities exist for access to care, referral frequency, number of service hours, and proportion of unmet service needs. Evidence revealed that racial and ethnic minority groups and children from low-income families have less access to acute care, specialized services, educational services, and community services compared with higher-income and white families. We found no studies in which differences in intervention effectiveness were examined. Several studies revealed disparities such that African American and Hispanic families and those from low-income households reported lower quality of care.','The body of literature on this topic is small; hence it served as a limitation to this review.','The documented disparities in access and quality of care may further identify groups in need of outreach, care coordination, and/or other interventions."
"Black patients are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to compare risks of hospitalization of Black and non-Black COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department and, of those hospitalized, to compare mortality and acute kidney injury.','A retrospective cohort of 831 adult COVID-19 patients (68.5% Black) who presented to the emergency departments of four academic hospitals, March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020. The primary outcome was risk of hospitalization among Blacks vs. non-Blacks. Secondary outcomes were mortality and acute kidney injury, among hospitalized patients.','The crude odds of hospitalization were not different in Black vs. non-Black patients; however, with adjustment for age, Blacks had 55% higher odds of hospitalization. Mortality differed most in the model adjusted for age alone. Acute kidney injury was more common in the Black hospitalized patients, regardless of adjustment. Stratified analyses suggested that disparities in the risk of hospitalization and of in-hospital acute kidney injury were highest in the youngest patients.','Our report shows that Black and non-Black patients presenting to the emergency department with COVID-19 had similar risks of hospitalization and, of those who were hospitalized, similar mortality when adjusted for multiple factors. Blacks had higher risk of acute kidney injury. Our results suggest that examination of disparities without exploration of the individual effects of age and comorbidities may mask important patterns. While stratified analyses suggest that disparities in outcomes may differ substantially by age and comorbid conditions, further exploration among these important subgroups is needed to better target interventions to reduce disparities in COVID-19 clinical outcomes."
"Over the past decade, the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) has become a preeminent model for primary care delivery. Simultaneously, health care disparities have gained increasing attention. There has been limited research on whether and how the PCMH can or should affect health care disparities. The authors conducted qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and experts on the PCMH model and health care disparities, including grant and policy makers, accreditors, researchers, patient advocates, primary care practices, practice transformation organizations, and payers, to assess perspectives on the role of the PCMH in addressing health care disparities. The application of grounded theory and thematic analysis elucidated best practice recommendations for the PCMH model's role in addressing health care disparities. Although the majority of stakeholders support greater integration of efforts to reduce health care disparities into the PCMH model, most stakeholders view the current PCMH model as having minimal or indirect influence on health care disparities. The majority supported greater integration of efforts to reduce health care disparities into the PCMH model. As the PCMH model continues to be refined, and as the health care system strives toward improving population health, there must be reflection on the policies and delivery systems that impact health care disparities."
"The US health care system is in the midst of incredible transformation. High-value, high-quality health care is the ultimate goal. Guided by the Institute of Medicine report ""Crossing the Quality Chasm,"" the focus is to deliver care that is safe, efficient, effective, timely, patient centered, and equitable. Equity is the principle that quality of care should not vary based on patient characteristics, such as race or ethnicity. Even with the same insurance and socioeconomic status and when comorbidities, stage of presentation, and other confounders are controlled for, minorities often receive a lower quality of health care than their white counterparts. These racial and ethnic disparities in quality of care contribute to disparities in health outcomes and higher costs. Radiology is not exempt from this issue, as disparities related to imaging services have been reported in the literature. The root causes of racial and ethnic disparities in health care are complex and include the negative impact of the social determinants of health, limited access to care, as well as health system, provider, and patient factors. The field of radiology has a unique opportunity to engage in efforts to improve quality, address disparities, and achieve equity. A call to action is necessary, with a focus on addressing social determinants of health; creating culturally, linguistically, and health literacy-appropriate outreach and services; investing in cross-cultural education; and diversifying the radiology workforce. Ultimately, radiologists can provide equitable access to radiology care and promote person-centered care solutions that are tailored to the needs of diverse populations."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly altered ambulatory health care delivery and may have worsened disparities in health care access. To assess the telehealth implementation experiences of ambulatory personnel in different disciplines and their perspectives on potential telehealth disparities, and to make recommendations for more equitable telehealth delivery. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Clinic managers from geriatric medicine, internal medicine, and psychiatry e-mailed a survey to clinicians and staff regarding experiences with telehealth care delivery. Quantitative survey responses were analyzed with Fisher's Exact tests. Qualitative responses were coded thematically. Recommendations were categorized by type of implementation strategy. Quantitative and qualitative findings on telehealth disparities were merged in a joint data display. Respondents (n = 147, 57% response rate) were distributed across three specialties: 66% internal medicine, 19% psychiatry, and 14% geriatric medicine. Prior to 2020, 77% of clinicians had never delivered telehealth services. By Spring 2020, 78% reported conducting more than half of clinic visits by telehealth. Among clinicians, 52% agreed/strongly agreed that rapid telehealth implementation exacerbated access to care disparities to: older adult patients, those with limited internet access, and those needing interpretation services. Staff expressed similar difficulties with telehealth set-up especially for these patients. To improve telehealth equity, clinicians recommended to: (i) change infrastructure; (ii) train and educate stakeholders; and (iii) support clinicians. Clinicians and staff reported specific subpopulations had challenges in accessing telehealth visits. To avoid perpetuating telehealth access disparities, further co-discovery of equitable implementation strategies with patients and clinics are urgently needed."
"Black individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) are less likely to receive effective treatment and more likely to be incarcerated compared to White individuals. Despite this, research documenting racial disparities in healthcare use among people with SUD releasing from prison is limited.','The goals of this study are to: 1) assess racial disparities in Medicaid enrollment among individuals released from prison with a history of substance use; and 2) characterize racial disparities in outpatient service use, emergency department (ED) use, and receipt of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) among those who do enroll in Medicaid.','This study included individuals with a history of substance use that were released from Wisconsin state correctional facilities from April 2015 through June 2017. Medicaid enrollment and claims data were analyzed to compare healthcare utilization 6 months post-release between individuals identifying as Black, White, or other races. The total sample included 15,621 prison releases among 14,400 unique persons with a history of substance abuse.','Among the 15,621 prison releases, 10,836 (69.4%) were enrolled in Medicaid in the month of release. The proportion of prison releases among individuals of other races who enrolled in Medicaid (506/934, 54.2%) was significantly lower than the proportion among Black individuals (3679/5306, 69.3%) and White individuals (6651/9381, 70.9%). Among the subset of 7685 releases enrolled in Medicaid for 6 months post-release, 5040 (65.6%) had an outpatient visit within 6 months; 73.9% of White, 51.3% of Black, and 66.9% of other individuals. Relative to White individuals, Black individuals were 0.324 times less likely (P < 0.001) and individuals of other races were 0.591 times less likely (P = 0.004) to have an outpatient visit. Of the 7685 releases, 1016 (13.2%) had an ED visit within 6 months; 12.0% of White, 13.8% of Black and 25.1% of other individuals. Relative to White individuals, Black individuals were 1.23 times more likely (P = 0.019) and individuals of other races were 2.64 times more likely (P < 0.001) to have an ED visit. Black individuals were 0.100 times less likely (P < 0.001) and individuals of other races were 0.435 times less likely (P = 0.016) to receive MOUD post-release compared to White individuals.','Black adults with a history of substance use are significantly less likely than White adults to use non-emergency outpatient services after release from incarceration. Improving equitable access to outpatient services is needed to reduce health disparities across racial groups."
"To quantify the gap between radiology and other specialties regarding the amount of literature on healthcare disparities (HCD).','Four different searches were conducted to evaluate the amount of literature on HCD in radiology as compared to internal medicine and surgery. Initially, the Journal Citation Report was utilized to search for the five highest ranking journals in each field and a second search used impact factor. A combination of search terms ""health"" AND ""disparities"" was used. Two additional searches were performed with PubMed using the terms ""health"" AND ""disparities AND ""radiology"" with the final term changed for each specialty. The second PubMed search added the term ""medical education"" for each specialty. Articles were limited to years 2017 to 2020.','The initial search found 1817 articles discussing ""health"" and ""disparities"". 14.6% of these were radiology, 65.7% internal medicine, and 19.7% surgery. The subsequent search controlling for impact factor found 2176 articles. 12.2% were for radiology, 66.1% were for internal medicine, and 21.7% for surgery. The initial PubMed search found 6543 articles. 9.9% were for radiology, 32.4% for internal medicine, and 57.7% were for surgery. The addition of ""medical education"" decreased the articles to 807.

"<b>Purpose:</b> Equal-access health care systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) reduce financial and nonfinancial barriers to care. It is unknown if such systems mitigate racial/ethnic mortality disparities, such as those well documented in the broader U.S. population. We examined racial/ethnic mortality disparities among VHA health care users, and compared racial/ethnic disparities in VHA and U.S. general populations. <b>Methods:</b> Linking VHA records for an October 2008 to September 2009 national VHA user cohort, and National Death Index records, we assessed all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular-related mortality through December 2011. We calculated age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted mortality hazard ratios. We computed sex-stratified, age-standardized mortality risk ratios for VHA and U.S. populations, then compared racial/ethnic disparities between the populations. <b>Results:</b> Among VHA users, American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs) had higher adjusted all-cause mortality, whereas non-Hispanic Blacks had higher cause-specific mortality versus non-Hispanic Whites. Asians, Hispanics, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders had similar, or lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality versus non-Hispanic Whites. Mortality disparities were evident in non-Hispanic-Black men compared with non-Hispanic White men in both VHA and U.S. populations for all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer (cause-specific) mortality, but disparities were smaller in VHA. VHA non-Hispanic Black women did not experience the all-cause and cause-specific mortality disparity present for U.S. non-Hispanic Black women. Disparities in all-cause and cancer mortality existed in VHA but not in U.S. population AI/AN men. <b>Conclusion:</b> Patterns in racial/ethnic disparities differed between VHA and U.S. populations, with fewer disparities within VHAs equal-access system. Equal-access health care may partially address racial/ethnic mortality disparities, but other nonhealth care factors should also be explored."
"Adult mortality varies greatly by educational attainment. Explanations have focused on actions and choices made by individuals, neglecting contextual factors such as economic and policy environments. This study takes an important step toward explaining educational disparities in U.S. adult mortality and their growth since the mid-1980s by examining them across U.S. states. We analyzed data on adults aged 45-89 in the 1985-2011 National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File (721,448 adults; 225,592 deaths). We compared educational disparities in mortality in the early twenty-first century (1999-2011) with those of the late twentieth century (1985-1998) for 36 large-sample states, accounting for demographic covariates and birth state. We found that disparities vary considerably by state: in the early twenty-first century, the greater risk of death associated with lacking a high school credential, compared with having completed at least one year of college, ranged from 40 % in Arizona to 104 % in Maryland. The size of the disparities varies across states primarily because mortality associated with low education varies. Between the two periods, higher-educated adult mortality declined to similar levels across most states, but lower-educated adult mortality decreased, increased, or changed little, depending on the state. Consequently, educational disparities in mortality grew over time in many, but not all, states, with growth most common in the South and Midwest. The findings provide new insights into the troubling trends and disparities in U.S. adult mortality."
"Research has documented a low rate of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment utilization among individuals involved in the criminal justice system. However, racial disparities in sources of payment for OUD treatment have not been examined in the existing literature.','Although substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is relatively rare for all criminal justice system involved racial-groups, previous research has indicated that, among individuals with SUD, members of racial minority groups receive treatment at lower rates than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. Given the alarming rise of OUD in the US and the association between source of payment and utilization of health care services, this study seeks to quantify racial disparities in sources of payment for OUD treatment among individuals with criminal justice involvement.','Using data from the 2008-2016 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), this study analyzes data on non-incarcerated individuals with OUD who have had any criminal justice involvement in the previous 12 months. An extension of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method for non-linear models is implemented to determine the extent that differences in OUD treatment utilization across non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites are explained by observed and measurable characteristics and/or unobserved factors.','Results indicate that non-Hispanic Whites are more likely to have their OUD treatment paid by a court (10%) relative to non-Hispanic Blacks (4.0%). Black-White differences in measurable factors explain 87% of the disparity, while the rest is attributed to unobserved factors. Non-Hispanic Blacks are more likely to have their OUD treatment paid by public insurance (77% vs 36%) than non-Hispanic Whites and only 72% of this disparity can be explained by observed characteristics.','Our findings indicate racial disparities in sources of payment for OUD treatment among the criminal justice-involved population. Expansion of health insurance coverage and access to substance use disorder treatments would be beneficial for reducing health care disparities.','Equitable treatment options in the criminal justice system that incentivize OUD treatment availability may help address racial disparities in sources of payment among the criminal justice-involved population with OUD.','Future research should focus on understanding the main factors driving the court's treatment decisions among the criminal justice system involved individuals."
"Despite significant research, the reasons for racial health disparities among adverse birth outcomes (ABO) remain largely unknown. The bulk of research into racial health disparities among ABO in the United States has concentrated on the risk of race and ethnic groups relative to the specific sub-population of non-Hispanic white women and their children. The objective of this study was to estimate the racial and ethnic risks among a set of neonatal and maternal health disparities while minimizing bias attributable to how the baseline risk was established.','All birth records were obtained from the United States Natality database for the years 2014 to 2017. A Bayesian modeling approach was used to estimate the risk disparity for disorders by race. The estimation of the race-specific risks used a sum-to-zero constraint for the race regression coefficients.','Estimating racial health disparities relative to the overall population rate yielded novel results and identified perinatal health disparities for all the race groups studied.','Unbiased risk estimates for racial disparities among ABO are now available for stimulating and initiating more complex causal modeling that can lead to understanding how racial health disparities for ABO are mediated and how they can be prevented."
"Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is a novel procedure recommended by the American Urological Association for Prostate Cancer (PCa) diagnosis. In radiology, differences in utilization of expensive screening techniques are described but never reviewed for mpMRI. Thus, our article aims at summarizing disparities relating to the expensive yet revolutionary mpMRI in United States men with PCa while highlighting needed research areas.','Eligible articles were gathered via PubMed query, referred publications known to the authors or from the reference lists of the identified publications. We excluded studies that didn't specifically evaluate mpMRI technique, weren't conducted in the United States, or didn't directly assess the relationship between disparities and mpMRI. No date restrictions were applied, resulting articles were published through 2020.','Out of 80 publications, 17 were selected. Two unique themes were identified: 1) disparities in mpMRI utilization, and 2) performance. While demographic factors such as race, age and socioeconomic status played a significant role in utilization, mpMRI demonstrated equal and sometimes superior performance in AAs.','Our findings illustrate the importance of disparity awareness in PCa mpMRI and highlight the need to examine additional mpMRI disparities across other races and social determinants. A new area of inequity in PCa was theoretically illustrated, as lower utilization of mpMRI was detected in a group that could potentially benefit from it the most. Major limitation was the selected search terms. Our review is unique as disparities related to mpMRI were found to be multilayered, affecting utilization and performance. Continued research is needed to discover additional areas in efforts to reduce disparity gaps related to mpMRI and PCa."
"Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces NSCLC mortality; however, a lack of diversity in LCS studies may limit the generalizability of the results to marginalized groups who face higher risk for and worse outcomes from NSCLC. Identifying sources of inequity in the LCS pipeline is essential to reduce disparities in NSCLC outcomes. The authors searched 3 major databases for studies published from January 1, 2010 to February 27, 2020 that met the following criteria: 1) included screenees between ages 45 and 80 years who were current or former smokers, 2) written in English, 3) conducted in the United States, and 4) discussed socioeconomic and race-based LCS outcomes. Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias. Of 3721 studies screened, 21 were eligible. Eligible studies were evaluated, and their findings were categorized into 3 themes related to LCS disparities faced by Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals: 1) eligibility; 2) utilization, perception, and utility; and 3) postscreening behavior and care. Disparities in LCS exist along racial and socioeconomic lines. There are several steps along the LCS pipeline in which Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals miss the potential benefits of LCS, resulting in increased mortality. This study identified potential sources of inequity that require further investigation. The authors recommend the implementation of prospective trials that evaluate eligibility criteria for underserved groups and the creation of interventions focused on improving utilization and follow-up care to decrease LCS disparities."
"Though the modern era has proven to be reassuring with the advancement of perioperative care leading to improved survival, congenital heart disease (CHD) continues to underscore its significance in the lives of newborns and families worldwide. Particularly, CHD has disproportionately afflicted vulnerable minorities such as Black and Hispanic populations from the standpoint of ethnic disparities in mortality following heart surgery, increased resource utilization, and longer durations of stay. This study aims to identify and provide insight regarding the relationships between the aforementioned factors to develop targeted strategies of intervention to mitigate the outcomes for patients of these specific populations.','Free, current peer-reviewed literature from databases such as the American Heart Association, The European Heart Journal, Science Direct, and PubMed regarding CHD, racial disparities, and socioeconomic variances were accessed. The study was narrowed to a patient population including only infants without chromosomal anomalies or those that passed away before hospital discharge.','Having private insurance and maternal education showed positive correlations with positive outcomes of patients post congenital heart surgery. Teaching hospitals were linked with increased mortality and complications. Male infants showed higher rates of complications. Hispanics had increased odds of complications. Black patients had increased risk for failures in being rescued.','Race plays a major role in the disparities in CHD, it is imperative to evaluate the socioeconomic contributors, surgical efforts, and provisions in place regarding minority patients. The apparency of these disparities, and willingness to invoke changes in practice has the potential for improvements in outcomes for these patients."
"To access urban-rural disparities in vaccination service use among Medicaid-enrolled adolescents and examine its association with residence county characteristics.','We used the 2016 Medicaid T-MSIS Analytic File to estimate adolescents' use of vaccination services, defined as the proportion of adolescents aged 11-18 years with ≥ 1 vaccination visit in a county. We used linear regression and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method to examine the association between county characteristics and urban-rural disparities in vaccination service use.','The analysis included 2,473 counties located in 38 states. The mean proportion of adolescents making ≥ 1 vaccination visit at the county level was low (36.09%) and was lower in rural than in urban counties (31.99% vs. 36.85%, p < .01). The number of primary care physicians (PCPs) was positively associated with vaccination service use in rural counties; in urban counties, % of households without a vehicle was negatively associated with vaccination service use. The decomposition results showed that 66.78% (3.24 percentage points) of the urban-rural disparities in vaccination service use could be attributed to urban-rural differences in the county characteristics included in the study. Characteristics measuring access to care (number of PCPs), social and economic factors (% adults with at least a bachelor's degree and % children in poverty), quality of care (influenza vaccination rates and preventable hospital stays), and demographics (% non-Hispanic black, % Hispanic, and % females) played a role in urban-rural disparities.','Differences in county characteristics could partly explain the observed urban-rural disparities in vaccination service use among low-income adolescents."
"Our goal was to identify racial and ethnic disparities in health outcome and care measures in Wisconsin.','We used electronic health record data from 25 health systems submitting to the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality to identify disparities in measures, including vaccinations, screenings, risk factors for chronic disease, and chronic disease management.','American Indian/Alaska Native and Black populations experienced substantial disparities across multiple measures. Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and White populations experienced substantial disparities for 2 measures each.','Reducing health disparities is a statewide imperative. Root causes of health disparities, such as systemic racism and socioeconomic factors, should be addressed for groups experiencing multiple disparities, with focused efforts on selected measures when indicated."
"Hip fractures are associated with 1-year mortality rates as high as 19% to 33%. Nonwhite patients have higher mortality and lower mobility rates at 6 months postoperatively than white patients. Studies have extensively documented racial disparities in hip fracture outcomes, but few have directly assessed racial disparities in the timing of hip fracture care.','Our purpose was to assess racial disparities in the care provided to patients with hip fractures. We asked, (1) do racial disparities exist in radiographic timing, surgical timing, length of hospital stay, and 30-day hospital readmission rates? (2) Does the hospital type modify the association between race and the outcomes of interest?','We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1535 patients aged 60 years or older who were admitted to the emergency department and treated surgically for a hip fracture at one of five hospitals (three community hospitals and two tertiary hospitals) in our health system from 2015 to 2017. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to assess associations between race and the outcomes of interest.','After adjusting for patient characteristics, we found that black patients had a longer mean time to radiographic evaluation (4.2 hours; 95% confidence interval, -0.6 to 9.0 versus 1.2 hours; 95% CI, 0.1-2.3; p = 0.01) and surgical fixation (41 hours; 95% CI, 34-48 versus 34 hours 95% CI, 32-35; p < 0.05) than white patients did. Hospital type only modified the association between race and surgical timing. In community hospitals, black patients experienced a 51% (95% CI, 17%-95%; p < 0.01) longer time to surgery than white patients did; however, there were no differences in surgical timing between black and white patients in tertiary hospitals. No race-based differences were observed in the length of hospital stay and 30-day hospital readmission rates.','After adjusting for patient characteristics, we found that black patients experienced longer wait times to radiographic evaluation and surgical fixation than white patients. Hospitals should consider evaluating racial disparities in the timing of hip fracture care in their health systems. Raising awareness of these disparities and implementing unconscious bias training for healthcare providers may help mitigate these disparities and improve the timing of care for patients who are at a greater risk of delay.','Level III, therapeutic study."
"This paper presents research conducted by the Arlington County Department of Human Services to understand the use of safety net services during the pandemic, identify disparities, and reduce or eliminate them. Arlington County's levels of health and economic wellbeing are generally high; however, residents of color experience significant disparities compared with White residents, with lower median incomes, lower rates of college completion, lower life expectancies, and higher rates of chronic illness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these disparities were amplified as Black and Latinx residents experienced disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death, as well as disproportionately high rates of job loss. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Arlington County mounted an interdisciplinary response to stabilize community needs, including food security, eviction prevention, isolation housing, behavioral health stabilization, and digital equity. This integrated approach was especially important during the pandemic, as the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic disproportionately impacted health and economic wellbeing among Arlington's Black and Latinx residents, low-income residents, and vulnerable communities."
"Asian Americans are the only racial/ethnic group in the U.S. for whom cancer is the leading cause of death in men and women, unlike heart disease for all other groups. Asian Americans face a confluence of cancer risks, with high rates of cancers endemic to their countries of origin due to infectious and cultural reasons, as well as increasing rates of ""Western"" cancers that are due in part to assimilation to the American diet and lifestyle. Despite the clear mortality risk, Asian Americans are screened for cancers at lower rates than the majority of Americans. Solutions to eliminate the disparity in cancer care are complicated by language and cultural concerns of this very heterogeneous group. This review addresses the disparities in cancer screening, the historical causes, the potential contribution of racism, the importance of cultural perceptions of health care, and potential strategies to address a very complicated problem. Noting that the health care disparities faced by Asian Americans may be less conspicuous than the structural racism that has inflicted significant damage to the health of Black Americans over more than four centuries, this review is meant to raise awareness and to compel the medical establishment to recognize the urgent need to eliminate health disparities for all. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Cancer is the leading cause of death in Asian Americans, who face cancers endemic to their native countries, perhaps because of infectious and cultural factors, as well as those faced by all Americans, perhaps because of ""Westernization"" in terms of diet and lifestyle. Despite the mortality rates, Asian Americans have less cancer screening than other Americans. This review highlights the need to educate Asian Americans to improve cancer literacy and health care providers to understand the important cancer risks of the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group in the U.S. Eliminating disparities is critical to achieving an equitable society for all Americans."
"Avoidable differences in the care and outcomes of patients with cancer (i.e., cancer care disparities) emerge or worsen with discoveries of new, more effective approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment. The rapidly expanding use of immunotherapy for many different cancers across the spectrum from late to early stages has, predictably, been followed by emerging evidence of disparities in access to these highly effective but expensive treatments. The danger that these new treatments will further widen preexisting cancer care and outcome disparities requires urgent corrective intervention. Using a multilevel etiologic framework that categorizes the targets of intervention at the individual, provider, health care system, and social policy levels, we discuss options for a comprehensive approach to prevent and, where necessary, eliminate disparities in access to the clinical trials that are defining the optimal use of immunotherapy for cancer, as well as its safe use in routine care among appropriately diverse populations. We make the case that, contrary to the traditional focus on the individual level in descriptive reports of health care disparities, there is sequentially greater leverage at the provider, health care system, and social policy levels to overcome the challenge of cancer care and outcomes disparities, including access to immunotherapy. We also cite examples of effective government-sponsored and policy-level interventions, such as the National Cancer Institute Minority-Underserved Community Oncology Research Program and the Affordable Care Act, that have expanded clinical trial access and access to high-quality cancer care in general."
"To identify patterns of age disparities in cancer survival, using colon and lung cancer as exemplars.','Systematic review of the literature.','We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science through 18 December 2020.','We retained all original articles published in English including patients with colon or lung cancer. Eligible studies were required to be population-based, report survival across several age groups (of which at least one was over the age of 65) and at least one other characteristic (eg, sex, treatment).','Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies against selected evaluation domains from the QUIPS tool, and items concerning statistical reporting. We evaluated age disparities using the absolute difference in survival or mortality rates between the middle-aged group and the oldest age group, or by describing survival curves.','Out of 3047 references, we retained 59 studies (20 for colon, 34 for lung and 5 for both sites). Regardless of the cancer site, the included studies were highly heterogeneous and often of poor quality. The magnitude of age disparities in survival varied greatly by sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, stage at diagnosis, cancer site, and morphology, the number of nodes examined and treatment strategy. Although results were inconsistent for most characteristics, we consistently observed greater age disparities for women with lung cancer compared with men. Also, age disparities increased with more advanced stages for colon cancer and decreased with more advanced stages for lung cancer.','Although age is one of the most important prognostic factors in cancer survival, age disparities in colon and lung cancer survival have so far been understudied in population-based research. Further studies are needed to better understand age disparities in colon and lung cancer survival.','CRD42020151402."
"In this systematic review, the authors report on the current state of health disparities research in plastic surgery and consider how equity-oriented interventions are taking shape at the patient, provider, and health care system levels.','The authors performed a systematic literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases using search terms related to the social determinants of both health and plastic surgery. Two independent reviewers screened the article titles and abstracts for relevance and identified the plastic surgery focus and study characteristics of the included literature. The articles were then categorized as detecting, understanding, or reducing health disparities according to a conceptual framework. This review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.','One hundred forty-seven articles published between 1997 and 2019 met the inclusion criteria. Health disparities research in gender-affirming, craniofacial, cosmetic, and hand surgery was lacking relative to breast reconstruction. Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities were reported across subspecialties. Place of residence was also a large determinant of access to care and quality of surgical outcomes. Half of the included studies were in the detecting phase of research. Meanwhile, 40 and 10 percent were in the understanding and reducing phases, respectively.','Investigators suggested several avenues for reducing health disparities in plastic surgery, yet there is limited evidence on the actual effectiveness of equity-oriented initiatives. More comprehensive research is needed to disentangle the patient, provider, and system-level factors that underlie inequity across subspecialties."
"The size and importance of socioeconomic status (SES)-based disparities in use of surgery for non-advanced stage gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have not been quantified.','The exposure in this study of patients age 18-80 with one of nine non-advanced stage GI cancers in the 2007-2015 SEER database was a census tract-level SES composite. Multivariable models assessed associations of SES with use of surgery. Causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of survival disparities in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 that were mediated by disparities in use of surgery.','Lowest SES quintile patients underwent surgery at significantly lower rates than highest quintile patients in each cancer. SES-based disparities in use of surgery were large and graded in esophagus adenocarcinoma, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Smaller but clinically relevant disparities were present in stomach, ampulla, and small bowel adenocarcinoma, whereas disparities were small in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Five-year all-stage overall survival (OS) was correlated with the size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 (r = - 0.87; p = 0.003). Mean OS was significantly longer (range 3.5-8.9 months) in SES quintile 5 versus 1. Approximately one third of SES-based survival disparities in poor prognosis GI cancers were mediated by disparities in use of surgery. The size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 was correlated with the proportion mediated (r = 0.98; p < 0.001).','Low SES patients with poor prognosis GI cancers are at substantial risk of undertreatment. Disparities in use of surgery contribute to diminished survival."
"Highlight examples of pediatric oncology nursing's accomplishments during the past 2 decades with attention to specialized practice, patient/family education, research/evidence-based practice, and advocacy and how these efforts can be leveraged to reduce disparities in the cure and care of children and adolescents with cancer.','Review of currently published literature, guidelines, and websites documenting pediatric oncology nursing's contributions.','Over the past 20 years, the collective work of pediatric oncology nurses across the world has improved the care of children with cancer and their families and brought attention to areas of disparities.','Although work remains to reduce disparities, current evidence from nursing science and practice is available to address disparities and guide advocacy efforts for children and their families as well as the nurses who care for them."
"Health and health care disparities are present in every medical specialty, and stem from multiple etiologies. Within health care itself, issues mostly arise within medical providers and across a system with an inequitable distribution of care and resources. One potential way to address disparities is to educate our workforce, to not only know about disparities but to also actively advocate for underresourced and marginalized patients. In this review, the authors describe efforts being conducted in graduate medical education and seek to elucidate some of the curricula currently being developed and implemented in rheumatology."
"Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults have elevated rates of substance use (SU) relative to heterosexual adults, yet the extent to which these disparities vary across age groups is unknown. Using national survey data, we test for age group differences in lifetime and recent SU disparities among LGB adults.','Using data on 67,354 adults (including 4868 LGB adults) from the 2015 and 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), we examined LGB disparities in lifetime and recent use of cigarettes, marijuana, and illicit drugs. Analyses were stratified by age groups (18-25, 26-34, and 35-49 years) and compared lesbian/gay (L/G) and bisexual adults, respectively, with heterosexual adults of the same gender and age group.','Among L/G women, disparities (relative to same-age heterosexual women) were significantly larger in the youngest age group compared with the older age groups for numerous measures of lifetime and recent SU. Conversely, among bisexual men and bisexual women, multiple SU disparities (relative to heterosexual adults of the same age and gender) were significantly smaller among the youngest age group compared with the oldest age group.','Contrary to hypotheses of decreased minority stress among more recent generations of LGB individuals, we found that SU disparities were not systematically smaller in younger age groups. Rather, disparities exhibited distinct trends across age groups. As NSDUH data are cross-sectional, differences by age group may reflect the influence of both age-varying developmental factors as well as time-varying social and contextual factors."
"Prior research demonstrates racial disparities in breast cancer treatment. Disparities are commonly attributed to more advanced stage at presentation or aggressive tumor biology. We seek to evaluate if racial disparities persist in the treatment of stage 1 breast cancer patients who by definition are not delayed in presentation.','We selected stage 1 breast cases in the National Cancer Data Base. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on race and included White and Black patients. We also performed a subgroup analysis of patients with private insurance for comparison to determine if private insurance diminished the racial disparities noted. We analyzed differences in time to treatments by race.','Our analysis included 546,351 patients of which 494,784 (90.6%) were White non-Hispanic and 51,567 (9.4%) were Black non-Hispanic. Black women had significantly longer times to first treatment (35.5 days vs 28.1 days), surgery (36.6 days vs 28.8 days), chemotherapy (88.1 days vs 75.4 days), radiation (131.3 days vs 99.1 days), and endocrine therapy (152.1 days vs 126.5 days) than White women. When patients with private insurance were analyzed the difference in time to surgery decreased by 1.2 days but racial differences remained statistically significant.','Despite selecting for early-stage breast cancer, racial disparities between White and Black women in time to all forms of breast cancer treatment persist. These disparities while likely not oncologically significant do suggest institutional barriers for obtaining care faced by women of color which may not be addressed with improving access to mammography alone."
"National changes in health care disparities within the setting of trauma care have not been examined within Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) or non-ACOs. We sought to examine the impact of ACOs on post-treatment outcomes (in-hospital mortality, 90-day complications, and readmissions), as well as surgical intervention among whites and nonwhites treated for spinal fractures.','We identified all beneficiaries treated for spinal fractures between 2009 and 2014 using national Medicare fee for service claims data. Claims were used to identify sociodemographic and clinical criteria, receipt of surgery and in-hospital mortality, 90-day complications, and readmissions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis accounting for all confounders was used to determine the effect of race/ethnicity on outcomes. Nonwhites were compared with whites treated in non-ACOs between 2009 and 2011 as the referent.','We identified 245,704 patients who were treated for spinal fractures. Two percent of the cohort received care in an ACO, whereas 7% were nonwhite. We found that disparities in the use of surgical fixation for spinal fractures were present in non-ACOs over the period 2009-2014 but did not exist in the context of care provided through ACOs (odds ratio [OR] 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44, 1.28). A disparity in the development of complications existed for nonwhites in non-ACOs (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01, 1.17) that was not encountered among nonwhites receiving care in ACOs (OR 1.32; 95% CI 0.90, 1.95). An existing disparity in readmission rates for nonwhites in ACOs over 2009-2011 (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.01, 1.80) was eliminated in the period 2012-2014 (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.65, 1.09).','Our work reinforces the idea that ACOs could improve health care disparities among nonwhites. There is also the potential that as ACOs become more familiar with care integration and streamlined delivery of services, further improvements in disparities could be realized."
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q) program aimed to improve health care quality and reduce racial and ethnic disparities in 16 diverse communities in the United States from 2006 to 2015; yet most communities failed to make substantive progress toward advancing health care equity by the program's end. This qualitative analysis of key stakeholder interviews aims to identify the major contributors to success versus failure in addressing local health disparities during AF4Q and identified five major themes. Three themes highlight challenges related to collecting local data on racial and ethnic health disparities and transitioning from data collection to action. Two themes capture the critical contribution of stakeholder engagement and access to technical expertise to successful efforts. The challenges and facilitators experienced by these 16 AF4Q communities may help inform the disparities reduction efforts of other communities and guide state or federal policies to reduce health disparities.
"Anti-Black racism is an established social determinant of racial health disparities in the United States. Although the majority of research on racism examines in-person individual-level experiences, a majority of Americans engage online and may therefore be exposed to racism directly or indirectly in online contexts. Research suggests that the structural technological features of online contexts may be especially powerful in perpetuating and enacting racism, often in inconspicuous or automated ways. However, there is a paucity of literature that articulates how structural online racism may be an important catalyst for racial health disparities, despite emerging evidence of racism embedded in our technological infrastructures. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to articulate the basis for investigating online racism as a form of structural racism with growing implications for racial health disparities in the digital age. We first define the structural features of online settings that generate and reinforce inequities among racial groups in the United States. Next, we propose a conceptual model detailing potential mechanisms through which structural online racism may translate into racial health disparities. Finally, we discuss ways in which exposures to online racism could be measured in order to capture their structural nature. Implications and future directions for research on online racism as a form of structural racism and corresponding policy for the reduction of racial health disparities are highlighted."
"Research has identified the United States (U.S.) as a global outlier in its firearm ownership rates, with a correspondingly higher risk of youth firearm violence compared to other countries. The relative extent of disparities in youth firearm violence within the U.S. has been less clear. Little is known about factors in the social ecology driving these disparities and whether current firearm violence prevention approaches sufficiently address them.','Applying a health disparities framework, we synthesized epidemiological, sociological, and prevention science literatures, emphasizing structural inequalities in youth sociocultural positionality in life course developmental context. We also highlighted findings from national injury data and other studies regarding the magnitude and impacts of youth firearm violence disparities.','The burden of firearm violence varied markedly at intersections of gender, race, place, developmental stage, and homicidal or suicidal intent. Firearm homicide among Black boys and young men (ages 15-24) was at outlier levels - many times greater than the rates of any other demographic group, developmental stage, or violence intent, particularly in urban settings. Recent research has operationalized structural racism and implicated historically racialized spaces as a root cause of this disparity. In contrast, elevated firearm suicide rates were found among Native and White boys and young men in rural settings; firearm-related cultural attitudes and gender socialization were points of consideration to explain these disparities. We highlighted research-based youth firearm violence preventive interventions, and emphasized gaps in efforts focused on structural and sociocultural factors.','More explicit attention to reducing firearm homicide among Black boys and young men and firearm suicide among Native and rural White boys and young men is urgently needed and has potential to substantially lower overall rates of firearm violence in the U.S."
"Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are among the most common and lethal types of cancer in children. However, the existence of health disparities in CNS tumors by race or ethnicity remains poorly understood. This systematic review sought to determine whether racial and ethnic disparities in incidence, healthcare access, and survival exist among pediatric patients diagnosed with CNS tumors.','A search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted. Inclusion criteria selected for studies published between January 1, 2005 and July 15, 2020 that focused on pediatric populations in the US, evaluated for potential differences based on racial or ethnic backgrounds, and focused on CNS tumors. A standardized study form was used to collect study information, population of interest, research design, and quality of analysis, sample size, participant demographics, pathology evaluated, and incidence or outcomes observed.','A total of 30 studies were inlcuded. Studies suggest White children may be more likely to be diagnosed with a CNS tumor and Hispanic children to present with advanced-stage disease and have worse outcomes. The degree of influence derived from socioeconomic factors is unclear. This review was limited by few available studies that included race and ethnicity as a variable, the overlap in databases used, and unclear categorization of race and ethnicity.','This review identified notable and at times contradicting variations in racial/ethnic disparities among children with CNS tumors, suggesting that the extent of these disparities remains largely unknown and prompts further research to improve health equity."
"On average, Washington D.C. residents experience low levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD) behavioral risk factors compared to the rest of the country. Despite presenting as a city of low risk, CVD mortality is higher than the national average. Driving this inconsistency are vast racial disparities as Black D.C. residents die from CVD at a much higher rate than their White counterparts. A closer examination of the data also reveals significant disparities between White and Black populations with regard to behavioral risk factors. Segregation and the built environments of sections of the city with large Black populations may be contributing to risk factor disparities. We examine factors in those built environments that contribute to disparities and assess the intentionality and effectiveness of policies focused on food access, physical activity, and tobacco use implemented between 2003 and 2014. We found that D.C. enacted few policies intentionally designed to reduce barriers in the physical environment that contributed to disparate outcomes, and the few that were implemented showed mixed results in their levels of effectiveness. Our findings demonstrated that both racial and geographical disparities have persisted for more than a decade and half. It is possible that the formation of intentional policies may help reduce barriers in the physical environment and disparate CVD outcomes."
"Current approaches to health care quality have failed to reduce health care disparities. Despite dramatic increases in the use of quality measurement and associated payment policies, there has been no notable implementation of measurement strategies to reduce health disparities. The National Quality Forum developed a road map to demonstrate how measurement and associated policies can contribute to eliminating disparities and promote health equity. Specifically, the road map presents a four-part strategy whose components are identifying and prioritizing areas to reduce health disparities, implementing evidence-based interventions to reduce disparities, investing in the development and use of health equity performance measures, and incentivizing the reduction of health disparities and achievement of health equity. To demonstrate how the road map can be applied, we present an example of how measurement and value-based payment can be used to reduce racial disparities in hypertension among African Americans."
"The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected minorities in population rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality. However, little is known about the broader racial disparities in fears and perceptions about the pandemic and getting treated.','To examine disparities in perceived risks of COVID-19 and getting medical care.','Using the nationally representative Stanford University School of Medicine Coronavirus Attitudes and Behaviors Survey fielded in May of 2020, we examine racial and ethnic disparities in eight measures on the perceived risks of COVID-19. We use regression analysis to risk adjust perceptions controlling for 10 socioeconomic, demographic, and health variables.','Black respondents were 15 percentage points more likely than White respondents to believe the pandemic would not end by Summer 2020 (92% vs 77%, p < .01), and were 19 percentage points more likely than any other race to feel a need to protect their family from COVID-19 (81% vs 62%, p < .01). Latinx respondents were 10 percentage points more fearful than White respondents of catching COVID-19 in public places (55% vs 45%, p < 0.01). Black respondents were 20 percentage points more likely than White respondents to think they would need medical care if infected (71% vs 51%, p < .01), and 18 percentage points more likely to think they would need to be hospitalized (59% vs 41%, p < .01). The proportion of Black respondents believing that the hospital would not have enough capacity to treat them if infected with COVID-19 was 12 percentage points higher than White respondents (41% vs 29%, p < 0.05).','Disparities in the COVID-19-related perceived risks and mistrust in healthcare across racial and ethnic groups existed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we enter into a post-COVID New Normal, new policies must ensure that the causes of this widespread fear and distrust in the healthcare system are understood and reversed."
"<b>Objective:</b> Although research on skin tone inequalities suggest that darker-skinned Black women should experience worse health outcomes than lighter-skinned women, findings have been mixed. The present study investigates the possibility that the manner that stress and health are measured (i.e. global versus count measures) may explain the conflicting findings. <b>Design:</b> Black American women of different skin tones were investigated in two cross-sectional samples: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (<i>N </i>= 571) and the Detroit Area Study (<i>N </i>= 290). Women's skin tone health disparities were examined using both objective (i.e. directly measured) or count measures (i.e. number of diagnosed chronic health conditions) as well as a global measure of health (i.e. self-rated health - SRH). Additionally, in the Detroit Area Study (DAS), disparities in stress exposure were examined using count and global measures. <b>Results:</b> Skin tone did not predict global measures of health (i.e. SRH) in both samples. In contrast, skin tone predicted objective and count measures of health in both samples, and the disparities between dark- and light-skinned women were starker among higher SES populations. Furthermore, DAS analyses of stress measures indicated that skin tone did not predict a global measure of stress but significantly predicted a count measure of stress (i.e. life events) since dark-skinned women reported worse outcomes. <b>Conclusions:</b> Health disparities research will benefit from accounting for Black women's skin tones as an important social determinant of health. Additionally, use of subjective measurements of health (e.g. SRH) may conceal within-race health disparities across complexions as well as obscure the magnitude of disparities across race."
"Increasing number of breast cancer survivors in the USA have led to greater focus on the long-term health outcomes and surveillance care among these women. However limited evidence exists of use of surveillance mammography among breast cancer survivors and how it varies across racial/ethnic groups.','We conducted a systematic review of the literature to explore disparities in use of surveillance mammogram among women breast cancer survivors by searching for relevant studies published between 2000 and 2020 from Medline (Ovid), PubMed (National Library of Medicine), and PsycINFO (Ovid) bibliographic databases. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of all articles that reported surveillance mammography use across racial/ethnic groups. Data on study design, screening eligibility, sample size, operational definition, and/or measure of the use of a surveillance mammogram among breast cancer survivors and the association between race/ethnicity and use of a surveillance mammogram were summarized in the evidence tables.','We identified 1544 records from the three databases, and 30 studies examined the use of surveillance mammograms among breast cancer survivors across race/ethnic groups. Of these, 21 provided adjusted estimates of racial/ethnic disparities in use of surveillance mammograms, and 15 of these reported statistically significant disparities. In summary, most studies reported that non-white women (mainly Blacks and Hispanics) were less likely to receive a timely surveillance mammogram compared to White.','This study extends the evidence of racial/ethnic disparities beyond completion of initial treatment by finding similar disparities in receipt of surveillance mammograms among breast cancer survivors.','Our findings identify a need to improve efforts to increase post-treatment use of surveillance mammography among racial/ethnic minority women to reduce these gaps and improve overall clinical and quality of life outcomes."
"As of June 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has led to more than 2.3 million confirmed infections and 121 thousand fatalities in the USA, with starkly different incidence by race and ethnicity. Our study examines racial and ethnic disparities in confirmed COVID-19 cases across six diverse cities-Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, New York City, San Diego, and St. Louis-at the ZIP code level (covering 436 ""neighborhoods"" with a population of 17.7 million). Our analysis links these outcomes to six separate data sources to control for demographics; housing; socioeconomic status; occupation; transportation modes; health care access; long-run opportunity, as measured by income mobility and incarceration rates; human mobility; and underlying population health. We find that the proportions of Black and Hispanic residents in a ZIP code are both positively and statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 cases per capita. The magnitudes are sizeable for both Black and Hispanic, but even larger for Hispanic. Although some of these disparities can be explained by differences in long-run opportunity, human mobility, and demographics, most of the disparities remain unexplained even after including an extensive list of covariates related to possible mechanisms. For two cities-Chicago and New York-we also examine COVID-19 fatalities, finding that differences in confirmed COVID-19 cases explain the majority of the observed disparities in fatalities. In other words, the higher death toll of COVID-19 in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities mostly reflects higher case rates, rather than higher fatality rates for confirmed cases."
"Blunted patterns of daily cortisol, an indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response system dysregulation, are implicated in poor health outcomes and racial health disparities. It is unknown how coping-an important, but understudied, component of the stress-health disparities relationship-relates to these biological mechanisms of health.','This study investigated relationships, including racial differences, between 12 coping strategies and early-day cortisol changes (diurnal cortisol slopes from peak to before lunch) among 700 35-85-year-old Black and White male participants in the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) II. Cognitive-oriented (e.g., positive reinterpretation, denial, religious/spiritual) and behavioral (e.g., stress eating, substance use) coping strategies were examined.','Overall, Black and White men used similar coping strategies. Most coping strategies were not associated with men's cortisol slopes. Religious/spiritual coping was associated with steeper (more robust) cortisol slopes among White (b = - 0.004, t = - 3.28, p = 0.001) but not Black men. Drug use was associated with steeper cortisol slopes among Black (b = - 0.095, t = - 2.87, p = 0.004) but not White men.','This exploratory study increases our understanding of relationships between coping and stress-related biological mechanisms underlying racial health disparities among men in later life. With some notable exceptions, men's coping strategies were not associated with their diurnal cortisol slopes. This suggests that the coping strategies currently used by older Black and White men may not be important factors, as determinants or intervention targets, in disparities in diurnal cortisol slopes and associated health outcomes among men in this age group."
"Underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. These disparities persist even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, raising the possibility that underserved patients' pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. Here we use a deep learning approach to measure the severity of osteoarthritis, by using knee X-rays to predict patients' experienced pain. We show that this approach dramatically reduces unexplained racial disparities in pain. Relative to standard measures of severity graded by radiologists, which accounted for only 9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 3-16%) of racial disparities in pain, algorithmic predictions accounted for 43% of disparities, or 4.7× more (95% CI, 3.2-11.8×), with similar results for lower-income and less-educated patients. This suggests that much of underserved patients' pain stems from factors within the knee not reflected in standard radiographic measures of severity. We show that the algorithm's ability to reduce unexplained disparities is rooted in the racial and socioeconomic diversity of the training set. Because algorithmic severity measures better capture underserved patients' pain, and severity measures influence treatment decisions, algorithmic predictions could potentially redress disparities in access to treatments like arthroplasty."
"Accumulating evidence suggests that sexual minority individuals are at increased risk for physical health conditions compared to heterosexual individuals. However, we know little about physical health disparities affecting bisexual individuals, a population at increased risk for psychiatric and substance use conditions compared to both heterosexual and lesbian/gay populations. Using a large, nationally representative sample, we examined physical health disparities for bisexual individuals. To advance research on sexual minority health disparities, we further: (1) compared prevalence rates of physical health conditions across three dimensions of sexual orientation (i.e., identity, attractions, behavior) and (2) examined whether disparities differed by sex and race/ethnicity. Results indicated that sexual minority individuals were at increased risk for many physical health conditions. Notably, individuals with bisexual identity, attractions, and/or behavior were at increased risk for more physical health conditions than other sexual minority groups. The number and types of physical health disparities affecting bisexually identified individuals and individuals with same- and opposite-sex attractions and/or sexual partners varied across sex and race/ethnicity, with the most consistent disparities emerging for individuals who reported same- and opposite-sex sexual partners. Our findings highlight the substantial physical health disparities affecting sexual minorities and the heightened risk conferred by all facets of bisexuality."
"Studies in low-resource settings have highlighted disparities in person-centred maternity care (PCMC)-respectful and responsive care during childbirth-based on women's socioeconomic status (SES) and other characteristics. Yet few studies have explored factors that may underlie these disparities. In this study, we examined implicit and explicit SES bias in providers' perceptions of women's expectations and behaviours, as well as providers' general views regarding factors influencing differential treatment of women. We conducted a convergent mixed-methods study with 101 maternity providers in western Kenya. Implicit SES bias was measured using an adaptation of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and explicit SES bias assessed using situationally specific vignettes. Qualitative data provided additional details on the factors contributing to disparities. Results provide evidence for the presence of both implicit and explicit bias related to SES that might influence PCMC. Differential treatment was linked to women's appearance, providers' perceptions of women's attitudes, assumptions about who is more likely to understand or be cooperative, women's ability to advocate for themselves or hold providers accountable, ability to pay for services in a timely manner, as well as situational factors related to stress and burnout. These factors interact in complex ways to produce PCMC disparities, and providing better care to certain groups does not necessarily indicate preference for those groups or a desire to provide better care to them. The findings imply the need for multilevel approaches to addressing disparities in maternity care. This should include provider training on PCMC and their biases, advocacy for women of low SES, accountability mechanisms, and structural and policy changes within health care settings."
"Racial-ethnic disparities in stroke recovery are well-established in the United States but the underlying causes are not well-understood. The typical assumption that racial-ethnic disparities in stroke recovery are explained by health care access inequities may be simplistic as access to stroke-related rehabilitation, for example, does not adequately explain the observed disparities. To approach the problem in a more comprehensive fashion, the Wide Spectrum Investigation of Stroke Outcome Disparities on Multiple Levels (WISSDOM) was developed to bring together scientists from Regenerative Medicine, Neurology, Rehabilitation, and Nursing to examine disparities in stroke ""recovery."" As a result, three related projects (basic science, clinical science and population science) were designed utilizing animal modeling, mapping of brain connections, and community-based interventions. In this article we describe: 1) the goals and objectives of the individual projects; and 2) how these projects could provide critical evidence to explain why racial-ethnic minorities traditionally experience recovery trajectories that are worse than Whites."
"This study examines whether there are racial/ethnic differences in perceived need for mental health care among those with a mood and/or anxiety disorder in 1990-1992 and 2001-2003 in the US. Then among those with perceived need, we examine whether racial/ethnic disparities in use of mental health care existed in both time periods.','Using data from the 1990-1992 National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and 2001-2003 National Comorbidity Survey - Replication (NCS-R), the study analyzes whether whites differed from blacks and Latinos in rates of perceived need among those with a mood and/or anxiety disorder in 1990-1992 and 2001-2003. Then among those with a disorder and perceived need, rates of mental health care use for whites are compared to black rates and Latino rates in within the 1990-1992 cohort and then within the 2001-2003 cohort.','There were no statistical racial/ethnic differences in perceived need in both time periods. Among those with perceived need in 1990-1992, there were no statistical racial/ethnic disparities in the use of mental health care. However, in 2001-2003, disparities in mental health care use existed among those with perceived need.','The emergence of racial/ethnic disparities in use of mental health care among those with a perceived need for care in 2001-2003 suggests that personal/cultural belief along with issues concerning access and quality of mental health care may create barriers to receiving perceived needed care. More research is needed to understand why these disparities emerged among those with perceived need in the latter time period and whether these disparities continue to exist in more recent years."
"Breast reconstruction after a mastectomy is an important component of breast cancer care that improves the quality of life in breast cancer survivors. African American women are less likely to receive breast reconstruction than Caucasian women. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the reconstruction disparities we previously reported at a comprehensive cancer center by assessing breast reconstruction rates, patterns, and predictors by race.','Data were obtained from women treated with definitive mastectomy between 2000 and 2012. Sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics were compared between African American and Caucasian women, and logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of reconstruction by race.','African American women had significantly larger proportions of public insurance, aggressive tumors, unilateral mastectomies, and modified radical mastectomies. African American women had a significantly lower reconstruction rate (35% vs. 49%, p < 0.01) and received a larger proportion of autologous reconstruction (13% vs. 7%, p < 0.01) compared to Caucasian women. The receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy was a significant predictor of breast reconstruction in Caucasian but not African American women.','We identified breast reconstruction disparities in rate and type of reconstruction. These disparities may be due to racial differences in sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics. The predictors of breast reconstruction varied by race, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying breast reconstruction may vary in African American women. Future research should take a target approach to examine the relative contributions of sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment determinants of the breast reconstruction disparities in African American women."
"Reducing health disparities requires an understanding of the mechanisms that generate disparities. Life course approaches to health disparities leverage theories that explain how socially patterned physical, environmental, and socioeconomic exposures at different stages of human development shape health within and across generations and can therefore offer substantial insight into the etiology of health disparities. Life course approaches are informed by developmental and structural perspectives. Developmental perspectives emphasize how socially patterned exposures to risk factors during sensitive life stages shift health trajectories, whereas structural perspectives emphasize how social identity and position within socially patterned environments disproportionately allocate risk factors and resources, resulting in altered health trajectories. We conclude that the science of health disparities will be advanced by integrating life course approaches into etiologic and intervention research on health disparities. The following 4 strategies are offered to guide in this process: (1) advance the understanding of multiple exposures and their interactions, (2) integrate life course approaches into the understanding of biological mechanisms, (3) explore transgenerational transmission of health disparities, and (4) integrate life course approaches into health disparities interventions."
"Socioeconomic disparities in health and healthcare are global issues that affect both adults as well as children. Children with exceptional healthcare needs, especially those with developmental impairments, including Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), encounter major disparities in access to and quality of health services. However, disparities in the population of children are rarely studied. The main aim of this paper is to study the socioeconomic disparities in children with ASD by examining the association between their Social Determinants of Health (SDH) status and access to and the quality of services.','This is a cross-sectional study on 202 children with ASD conducted in 2019 in two provinces including Ardabil and East-Azerbaijan, in the North-West of Iran. A structured, valid questionnaire was used to collect data on demographic, SDH status, quality of services, and access to services in a population of children with ASD aged 2-16-year-old. Around 77% participants were male and the mean age of children was 2 years and 6 months. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to assess the relationship.','Based on the results of this study, the overall mean scores of the quality of services, access to services, and SDH status were 61.23 (30.01), 65.91 (21.89), and 29.50 (22.32) out of 100, respectively. All the associations between the quality and access dimensions and quality (B: 0.464-0.704) and access (B: 0.265-0.726) scales were statistically significant (P < 0.001). By adjusting to covariates, the access was also significantly related to service quality (P = 0.004). Finally, the associations between SDH score with service quality (P = 0.039) and access (P < 0.001) were positively significant.','There are socioeconomic disparities in the quality of and access to services among children with ASD, who use ASD services, in the North-West of Iran. We recommend health/medical centers, where children are diagnosed with ASD, conducting SDH screening and providing families of low-SDH status with specific information about the quality of and access to services for children with ASD. Additionally, medical universities must have a plan to routinely monitor the quality of and access to services provided for the children with low SDH."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic affects psychiatric patients disproportionately compared to the general population. In this narrative review, we examine the impact of the pandemic on significant global health disparities affecting vulnerable populations of psychiatric patients: People of diverse ethnic background and color, children with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, pregnant women, mature adults, and those patients living in urban and rural communities. The identified disparities cause worsened mental health outcomes placing psychiatric patients at higher risk for depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Those psychiatric patients who are ethnic minorities display barriers to care, including collective trauma and structural racism. Sexual and gender minorities with mental illness face discrimination and limited access to treatment. Pregnant women with psychiatric diagnoses show higher exposure to domestic violence. Children with disabilities face a higher risk of worsening behavior. Mature adults with psychiatric problems show depression due to social isolation. Psychiatric patients who live in urban communities face pollutants and overcrowding compared to those living in rural communities, which face limited access to telehealth services. We suggest that social programs that decrease discrimination, enhance communal resilience, and help overcome systemic barriers of care should be developed to decrease global health disparities in vulnerable population."
"Owing to multiple and multilevel ecological factors, sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations exhibit persistent mental health disparities. SGM populations are also at increased risk for never being reached by evidence-based mental health care in real-world settings, which is essential for reducing these disparities. To be maximally effective in reducing these disparities, we must strive to bring our research findings into routine clinical care quickly. Implementation science can help SGM health researchers achieve this goal. This perspective outlines how researchers can use implementation science theories and methods to reduce SGM mental health disparities more efficiently and more durably."
"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often benefit from allied health services such as occupational therapy, speech and language pathology, and applied behavioral analysis. While there is consistent evidence of disparities in access and use of medical services (e.g. dentistry), no such systematic review has examined disparities and differences in allied health use amongst children with ASD. In this systematic review, we examine disparities and differences in service access and use for children with ASD. Our findings suggest that children who are older, have less severe ASD symptoms, are from minority groups, and those from particular geographic regions are less likely to receive allied health services. Limitations and future directions are discussed."
"Lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults report higher rates of smoking and alcohol use than heterosexual peers. Prior studies have not examined whether potential disparities in early initiation among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth may contribute to adult disparities.','Data on 126,463 adults (including 8,241 lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults) were from the 2015-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Rates of reported early alcohol and smoking initiation (before age 15 years) among both lesbian/gay and bisexual adults were examined relative to same-gender heterosexual adults. Mediation analyses were used to assess whether early initiation differences contribute to disparities in adult heavy episodic drinking, alcohol use disorder, current smoking, and nicotine dependence for each subgroup. Analyses were conducted in 2018-2019.','For both lesbian/gay and bisexual women, early alcohol initiation rates were elevated and explained 21%-38% of their observed disparities in adult heavy episodic drinking and alcohol use disorder. Similarly, early smoking initiation rates were elevated among both lesbian/gay and bisexual women and explained 22%-29% of their disparities in adult smoking and nicotine dependence. By contrast, no evidence was observed that early initiation mediated adult disparities for gay or bisexual men.','A significant proportion of alcohol and smoking disparities among lesbian/gay and bisexual women in adulthood appear attributable to early initiation, indicating the need for enhanced early prevention efforts for these groups. Making routine adolescent screening for substance use, brief intervention, and referral to treatment more culturally sensitive to lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth may also be an important step in reducing adult disparities for lesbian, gay, and bisexual women."
"Seminal investigation 2 decades ago alerted the oncology community to age disparities in participation in cooperative group trials; less is known about whether these disparities persist in industry-funded research.','To characterize the age disparities among trial enrollees on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of common cancers in clinical oncology and identify factors associated with wider age imbalances.','Phase 3 clinical oncology RCTs were identified through ClinicalTrials.gov.','Multiarm RCTs assessing a therapeutic intervention for patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer (the 4 most common cancer disease sites) were included.','Trial data were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov. Trial screening and parameter identification were independently performed by 2 individuals. Data were analyzed in 2018.','The difference in median age (DMA) between the trial participant median age and the population-based disease-site-specific median age was determined for each trial.','Three hundred two trials met inclusion criteria. The trials collectively enrolled 262 354 participants; 249 trials (82.5%) were industry-funded. For all trials, the trial median age of trial participants was a mean of 6.49 years younger than the population median age (95% CI, -7.17 to -5.81 years; P < .001). Age disparities were heightened among industry-funded trials compared with non-industry-funded trials (mean DMA, -6.84 vs -4.72 years; P = .002). Enrollment criteria restrictions based on performance status or age cutoffs were associated with age disparities; however, industry-funded trials were not more likely to use these enrollment restrictions than non-industry-funded trials. Age disparities were also larger among trials that evaluated a targeted systemic therapy and among lung cancer trials. Linear regression modeling revealed a widening gap between trial and population median ages over time at a rate of -0.19 years annually (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.01 years; P = .04).','Age disparities between trial participants and the incident disease population are pervasive across trials and appear to be increasing over time. Industry sponsorship of trials is associated with heightened age imbalances among trial participants. With an increasing role of industry funding among cancer trials, efforts to understand and address age disparities are necessary to ensure generalizability of trial results as well as equity in trial access."
"The Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) at the University of North Texas Health Science Center is a National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities-funded, specialized center of excellence for health disparities. TCHD organized its 12<sup>th</sup> annual conference focusing on ""Evidence-Based Approaches to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities: Discover, Develop, Deliver, and Disseminate."" At this conference, experts in health care, biomedical sciences, and public health gathered to discuss the current status and strategies for reducing cancer health disparities. The meeting was conducted in three sessions on breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer disparities, in addition to roundtable discussions and a poster session. Each session highlighted differences in the effects of cancer, based on factors such as race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographical location. In each session, expert speakers presented their findings, and this was followed by a discussion panel made up of experts in that field and cancer survivors, who responded to questions from the audience. This article summarizes the approaches to fundamental, translational, clinical, and public health issues in cancer health disparities discussed at the conference."
"Demographic and social characteristics, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and income, have been implicated as risk and protective factors for behavior change regarding obesogenic behaviors in adolescents. The purpose of this study was to determine the social disparities in obesogenic behaviors and compare social disparities in obesogenic behaviors between adolescents who are overweight/obese and non-overweight adolescents using an alternative methodology for calculating disparities.','Data were obtained from the 2013 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Systems. Social disparities ratios for meeting fruit and vegetable recommendation, daily breakfast consumption, physical activity, and non-sedentary activity were calculated using the Extended Gastwirth Index Method. Independent sample t tests were used to compare social disparities between non-overweight and overweight/obese participants.','Racial disparities were the largest contributor to overall disparities for meeting fruit and vegetables recommendations, daily breakfast, and non-sedentary activity, while sex disparities were the largest contributor to overall disparities for meeting physical activity recommendations. The non-overweight group had lower free/reduced lunch disparities for all behaviors when compared to the overweight/obese group.','The results of this study confirmed that social disparities exist for obesogenic behaviors. The methodology allowed for the determination of the percentage change needed in behavior to eliminate disparities between groups. These calculations are a useful tool for identifying groups that should be targeted for intervention if disparities are to be reduced."
"There is growing recognition that the genomic and precision medicine revolution in health care can deepen health disparities. This has produced urgent calls to prioritize inclusion of historically underrepresented populations in research and to make genomic databases more inclusive. Answering the call to address health care disparities in the delivery of genomic and precision medicine requires a consideration of important, yet understudied, legal issues that have blocked progress. This article introduces a special issue of <i>Ethnicity & Disease</i> which contains a series of articles that grew out of a public conference to investigate these legal issues and propose solutions. This 2018 conference at Meharry Medical College was part of an NIH-funded project on ""LawSeq<sup>SM</sup>"" to evaluate and improve the law of genomics in order to support appropriate integration of genomics into clinical care. This conference was composed of presentations and interactive sessions designed to specify the top legal barriers to health equity in precision medicine and stimulate potential solutions. This article synthesizes the results of those discussions. Multiple legal barriers limit broad inclusion in genomic research and the development of precision medicine to advance health equity. Problems include inadequate privacy and anti-discrimination protections for research participants, lack of health coverage and funding for follow-up care, failure to use law to ensure access to genomic medicine, and practices by research sponsors that tolerate and entrench disparities. Analysis of the legal barriers to health equity in precision medicine is essential for progress. Progressive use of law is vital to avoid worsening of health care disparities."
"While colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rates have been decreasing, disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity persist. CRC screening rates remain suboptimal among low SES and racial/ethnic minority populations, despite the availability of multiple screening modalities. Understanding awareness, knowledge, and utilization of common screening modalities within different racial/ethnic and SES groups is critical to inform efforts to improve population screening uptake and reduce disparities in CRC-related health outcomes. Through the theoretical lenses of diffusion of innovation and fundamental cause theory, we examined the associations of race/ethnicity and SES with awareness, knowledge, and utilization of three guideline recommended CRC screening strategies among individuals at average risk for CRC. Data were obtained from a survey of a nationally representative panel of US adults conducted in November 2019. The survey was completed by 31.3% of invited panelists (1595 of 5097). Analyses were focused on individuals at average risk for CRC, aged 45-75 for awareness and knowledge outcomes (n = 1062) and aged 50-75 for utilization outcomes (n = 858). Analyses revealed racial/ethnic and SES disparities among the three CRC screening modalities, with more racial/ethnic and SES differences observed in the awareness, knowledge, and utilization of screening colonoscopy and mt-sDNA than FIT/gFOBT. Patterns of disparities are consistent with previous research showing that inequities in social and economic resources are associated with an imbalanced adoption of medical innovations. Our findings demonstrate a need to increase awareness, knowledge, and access of various CRC screening modalities in specific populations defined by race/ethnicity or SES indicators. Efforts to increase CRC screening should be tailored to the needs and social-cultural context of populations. Interventions addressing inequalities in social and economic resources are also needed to achieve more equitable adoption of CRC screening modalities and reduce disparities in CRC-related health outcomes."
"Health disparities in ASD detection affect children's access to subsequent interventions. We examined potential disparities in implementation of a multi-stage ASD screening and diagnostic evaluation protocol in Part C Early Intervention with 4943 children ages 14-36 months (mean 22.0 months; 62.9% boys, 73.3% children of color, 34.9% non-English-primary language, 64.5% publicly-insured). Participation and follow-through were high (64.9% and 65.3% at first- and second-stage screening, respectively, 84.6% at diagnostic evaluation). Logistic regressions identified predictors of screening participation and outcomes at each stage; demographic differences (race, language, public insurance) were observed only at first-stage screening and reflected higher participation for children of color and higher positive screens for publicly-insured children. Results suggest the multi-stage screening protocol shows promise in addressing disparities in early diagnosis."
"Policy Points Patients with low socioeconomic status (SES) experience poorer survival rates after diagnosis of breast cancer, even when enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. Most of the difference in survival is due to more advanced cancer on presentation and the general poor health of lower SES patients, while only a very small fraction of the SES disparity is due to differences in cancer treatment. Even when comparing only low- versus not-low-SES whites (without confounding by race) the survival disparity between disparate white SES populations is very large and is associated with lower use of preventive care, despite having insurance.','Disparities in breast cancer survival by socioeconomic status (SES) exist despite the ""safety net"" programs Medicare and Medicaid. What is less clear is the extent to which SES disparities affect various racial and ethnic groups and whether causes differ across populations.','We conducted a tapered matching study comparing 1,890 low-SES (LSES) non-Hispanic white, 1,824 black, and 723 Hispanic white women to 60,307 not-low-SES (NLSES) non-Hispanic white women, all in Medicare and diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1992 and 2010 in 17 US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) regions. LSES Medicare patients were Medicaid dual-eligible and resided in neighborhoods with both high poverty and low education. NLSES Medicare patients had none of these factors.','5-year and median survival.','LSES non-Hispanic white patients were diagnosed with more stage IV disease (6.6% vs 3.6%; p < 0.0001), larger tumors (24.6 mm vs 20.2 mm; p < 0.0001), and more chronic diseases such as diabetes (37.8% vs 19.0%; p < 0.0001) than NLSES non-Hispanic white patients. Disparity in 5-year survival (NLSES - LSES) was 13.7% (p < 0.0001) when matched for age, year, and SEER site (a 42-month difference in median survival). Additionally, matching 55 presentation factors, including stage, reduced the disparity to 4.9% (p = 0.0012), but further matching on treatments yielded little further change in disparity: 4.6% (p = 0.0014). Survival disparities among LSES blacks and Hispanics, also versus NLSES whites, were significantly associated with presentation factors, though black patients also displayed disparities related to initial treatment. Before being diagnosed, all LSES populations used significantly less preventive care services than matched NLSES controls.','In Medicare, SES disparities in breast cancer survival were large (even among non-Hispanic whites) and predominantly related to differences of presentation characteristics at diagnosis rather than differences in treatment. Preventive care was less frequent in LSES patients, which may help explain disparities at presentation."
"Housing quality is a primary determinant of asthma disparities by race and social class in the US. We sought to assess how housing code enforcement systems in Boston, Massachusetts, address tenants' reports of asthma triggers. After adjustment for income and other neighborhood characteristics, racial demographics were significantly associated with asthma trigger incidence. For each 10 percent decrease in neighborhood proportion of White residents, trigger incidence increased by 3.14 reports per thousand residents. These disparities persisted during the study period (from 2011 through 2021), and for mold, which is an established asthma trigger, regressions showed that racial disparities are widening. The municipal response also demonstrated disparities: In neighborhoods with the fewest White residents compared to neighborhoods with the most White residents, adjusted models showed a 17 percent (3.51 days) slower median time until cases (tenant requests for inspections to the Inspectional Services Department) were closed, a 14 percent higher probability of being flagged as overdue, and a 54.4 percent lower probability of a repair. We found evidence that in Boston, despite several healthy housing initiatives, current regulatory systems are insufficient to address disparities in access to healthy housing. To reduce disparities in asthma burden, stronger inspectional standards and further enforcement policies to increase landlords' accountability and support tenants' rights to have repairs made are essential."
"To assess publishing trends regarding the contribution of societal systems on health disparities within the urology literature.','We performed a bibliometric analysis of the top 15 urology journals for titles and abstracts with the term race or ethnicity between 2000-2021. Articles were graded by the presence of (1) race, (2) disparities secondary to race, or (3) racial disparities secondary to structural biases. Frequencies were tabulated and logistic regression was used to determine odds of disparities publishing.','Our query returned 934 articles for review. In 484 (52%) articles, race was mentioned as a demographic/covariate. 110 (12%) abstracts noted a racial health disparity and only 2 articles implicated racism. Rates of more direct language varied significantly by journal and year of publication. Discussion of disparities increased over time, ranging from 0% in 2002 to 25% in 2020 (P-trend <.001). Logistic regression demonstrated an 11% annual increase in the likelihood of disparity publishing (OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.08-1.14; P<.001).','While it is widely acknowledged that race is a determinant of health, often ""race"" itself is ascribed the risk when societal inequities are largely at fault. Despite the frequent use of race as a key covariate within the urologic literature, health-disparities relating to structural racism are rarely explicitly named. In order to address the systemic biases that underpin these inequities, increased awareness through clear language in publishing is needed."
"<i>Objectives.</i> To demonstrate how inferences about rural-urban disparities in age-adjusted mortality are affected by the reclassification of rural and urban counties in the United States from 1970 to 2018.<i>Methods.</i> We compared estimates of rural-urban mortality disparities over time, produced through a time-varying classification of rural and urban counties, with counterfactual estimates of rural-urban disparities, assuming no changes in rural-urban classification since 1970. We evaluated mortality rates by decade of reclassification to assess selectivity in reclassification.<i>Results.</i> We found that reclassification amplified rural-urban mortality disparities and accounted for more than 25% of the rural disadvantage observed from 1970 to 2018. Mortality rates were lower in counties that reclassified from rural to urban than in counties that remained rural.<i>Conclusions.</i> Estimates of changing rural-urban mortality differentials are significantly influenced by rural-urban reclassification. On average, counties that have remained classified as rural over time have elevated mortality. Longitudinal research on rural-urban health disparities must consider the methodological and substantive implications of reclassification.<i>Public Health Implications.</i> Attention to rural-urban reclassification is necessary when evaluating or justifying policy interventions focusing on geographic health disparities."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the United States has disproportionately impacted communities of color across the country. Focusing on COVID-19-attributable mortality, we expand upon a national comparative analysis of years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to COVID-19 by race/ethnicity (Bassett et al., 2020), estimating percentages of total YPLL for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, non-Hispanic Asians, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Natives, contrasting them with their respective percent population shares, as well as age-adjusted YPLL rate ratios-anchoring comparisons to non-Hispanic Whites-in each of 45 states and the District of Columbia using data from the National Center for Health Statistics as of 30 December 2020. Using a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to perform estimation, our results reveal substantial racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19-attributable YPLL across states, with a prevailing pattern of non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics experiencing disproportionately high and non-Hispanic Whites experiencing disproportionately low COVID-19-attributable YPLL. Furthermore, estimated disparities are generally more pronounced when measuring mortality in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting the greater intensity of the disparities at younger ages. We also find substantial state-to-state variability in the magnitudes of the estimated racial/ethnic disparities, suggesting that they are driven in large part by social determinants of health whose degree of association with race/ethnicity varies by state."
"Recent media coverage and research have emphasized increasing mortality rates for middle-aged white Americans. A concern is that this has shifted focus away from the health burden of other population subgroups. This cross-sectional study compares the magnitude of racial/ethnic mortality disparities across age groups and investigates how changing mortality trends have affected these disparities.','Mortality data from 2007 to 2016 by race/ethnicity and age were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database in 2018‒2019. Absolute and relative racial/ethnic mortality disparities by age groups were determined by calculating between-group variance and mortality rate-adjusted between-group variance, respectively. Trends in disparities were analyzed using joinpoint regression modeling. Annual percentage change in rate-adjusted between-group variance was calculated for each trend segment as well as the relative contribution of each racial/ethnic group to the change.','The largest relative and absolute disparities were found in the youngest and oldest age groups, respectively. Trend analysis detected an inflection point between 2009 and 2012 for most age groups where a period of decreasing disparities changed to one of increasing disparities. Three quarters of the decreasing disparities in Period 1 were resultant of lowering mortality among the black subgroup. During Period 2, the increase in child disparities were due to increased mortality among blacks, whereas increased adult disparities were due to increased mortality among whites shifting the overall mean away from subgroups with lower rates.','Racial/ethnic mortality disparities persist and are widening for some age groups. It is imperative to maintain focus on the age groups where those with historically poorer health are contributing most to the increase."
"American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study examines whether neighborhood characteristics mediate AI/AN versus White-non-Hispanic Veteran COVID-19 infection disparities, and whether mediation differs based on proximity to reservations.','Using Veteran Health Administration's (VHA) national database of VHA users evaluated for COVID-19 infection (3/1/2020-8/25/2020), we examined whether census tract neighborhood characteristics (percent households overcrowded, without complete plumbing, without kitchen plumbing, and neighborhood socioeconomic status [n-SES]) mediated racial disparities in COVID-19 infection, using inverse odds-weighted logistic models controlling for individual-level characteristics. Using moderated mediation analyses, we assessed whether neighborhood mediating effects on disparities differed for those residing in counties containing/near federally recognized tribal lands (i.e., Contract Health Service Delivery Area [CHSDA] counties) versus not.','The percent of households without complete plumbing, percent without kitchen plumbing, and n-SES partially mediated AI/AN-White-non-Hispanic COVID-19 infection disparities (accounting for 17-35% of disparity) to a similar extent in CHSDA and non-CHSDA counties. The percent of households without kitchen plumbing had stronger mediating effects for CHSDA than non-CHSDA residents.','Neighborhood-level social determinants of health may contribute to the disproportionate COVID-19 infection burden on AI/ANs; differences are exacerbated among AI/ANs living near reservations."
"One in every twenty-five persons in America is a racial/ethnic minority who lives in a rural area. Our objective was to summarize how racism and, subsequently, the social determinants of health disproportionately affect rural racial/ethnic minority populations, provide a review of the cancer disparities experienced by rural racial/ethnic minority groups, and recommend policy, research, and intervention approaches to reduce these disparities. We found that rural Black and American Indian/Alaska Native populations experience greater poverty and lack of access to care, which expose them to greater risk of developing cancer and experiencing poorer cancer outcomes in treatment and ultimately survival. There is a critical need for additional research to understand the disparities experienced by all rural racial/ethnic minority populations. We propose that policies aim to increase access to care and healthcare resources for these communities. Further, that observational and interventional research should more effectively address the intersections of rurality and race/ethnicity through reduced structural and interpersonal biases in cancer care, increased data access, more research on newer cancer screening and treatment modalities, and continued intervention and implementation research to understand how evidence-based practices can most effectively reduce disparities among these populations."
"Childhood exposure to neighborhood firearm violence adversely affects mental and physical health across the life course. Study objectives were to (1) quantify racial disparities in these exposures across the U.S. and (2) assess changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, when firearm violence increased.','The study used counts of children aged 5-17 years, disaggregated by U.S. Census racial category, for every census tract (N=73,056). Neighborhood firearm violence was the number of fatal shootings per census tract, based on 2015-2021 Gun Violence Archive data. Quasi-Poisson regressions were used to estimate baseline disparities and COVID-19‒related changes and examined differences across geographic regions.','Prepandemic exposure was lowest among White children and highest among Black children, who experienced 4.44 times more neighborhood firearm violence exposure (95% CI=4.33, 4.56, p<0.001) than White children. The pandemic increased exposure by 27% in the lowest risk group (i.e., White children; 95% CI=20%, 34%, p<0.001), but pandemic effects were even greater for children in nearly all non-White categories. Baseline violence levels and racial disparities varied considerably by region, with the highest levels in the South and the largest magnitude disparities observed in the Northeast and Midwest.','Large-scale racial disparities exist in child exposure to neighborhood firearm violence, and these disparities grew during the pandemic. Equitable access to trauma-informed programs, community-based prevention, and structural reforms are urgently needed."
"This study aimed to identify racial and ethnic disparities in prenatal mental health and identify COVID-19 pandemic-related health/healthcare and economic contributors to these disparities, using an established framework for disparity investigation.','This cross-sectional study includes 10,930 pregnant people at Kaiser Permanente Northern California who completed an online survey between June 22, 2020 and April 28, 2021 on COVID-19 pandemic-related health/healthcare and economic stressors, depression, and anxiety. Self-reported race and ethnicity were extracted from electronic health records. Weighted analyses were used to evaluate the association between racial and ethnic category and prenatal depression and anxiety; the prevalence of each stressor by race and ethnicity; and the relationship between each stressor and prenatal depression and anxiety in each racial and ethnic category.','The sample was 22% Asian, 3% Black, 20% Hispanic, 5% Other/Multiracial/Unknown, and 49% White. Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.35 and aPR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.37, respectively) and anxiety (aPR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.34, 2.18 and aPR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.29, respectively). Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of moderate/severe distress due to changes in prenatal care (24 vs. 34 and 31%), and food insecurity (9 vs. 31 and 24%). Among Black and Hispanic people, distress due to changes in prenatal care was associated with a greater prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.64 and aPR: 2.76, 95% CI: 2.12, 3.58, respectively) and prenatal anxiety (aPR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.85, 4.84 and aPR: 2.82, 95% CI: 2.15, 3.71, respectively). Additionally, among Hispanic people, high-risk employment and food insecurity were associated with a greater prevalence of prenatal depression and anxiety.','This study identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health for pregnant Black and Hispanic people. Distress due to prenatal care changes contributed to the observed disparities in prenatal depression and anxiety for Black and Hispanic people and food insecurity additionally contributed to the observed disparities for Hispanic people. Addressing distress due to changes to prenatal care and food insecurity specifically in Black and Hispanic people may help reduce the high burden of poor mental health and reduce observed disparities in these communities."
"Prior studies of breast cancer disparities have focused primarily on differences between Black and White women, yet contemporary patterns of disparity for other groups are not well understood. We examine breast cancer disparities by stage at diagnosis across nine racial and ethnic groups.','The SEER 18 registries identified 841,975 women diagnosed with breast cancer from 2000 to 2017. Joinpoint models assessed trends in diagnosis stage and survival. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and diagnosis stage. Multivariable Cox models compared survival of groups by stage and molecular subtype.','Black, American Indian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, Pacific Islander and Hispanic women were less likely than white women to be diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. Among those diagnosed at early stage, Hispanic, American Indian, Pacific Islander and Black women were 9%, 14%, 22% and 39% (respectively) more likely than White women to die from breast cancer, whereas Asian subgroups had lower risk of death. Among those diagnosed at late stage, Black women were 18% more likely than White counterparts to die from breast cancer, and survival disparities for Black women persisted across all subtypes and stages, (except late stage HR-/HER2-). East Asian women with early stage HR+/HER2- tumors had better survival than White women.','Persistent disparities in early detection and survival of breast cancer demand further work to address and reduce disparities across the cancer continuum.','Results have implications for efforts to reduce entrenched racial and ethnic disparities in breast cancer early detection and survival."
"<b>Background:</b> Despite decades of research and interventions, significant health disparities persist. Seventeen years is the estimated time to translate scientific discoveries into public health action. This Narrative Review argues that the translation process could be accelerated if representative data were gathered and used in more innovative and efficient ways. <b>Methods:</b> The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities led a multiyear visioning process to identify research opportunities designed to frame the next decade of research and actions to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. ""Big data"" was identified as a research opportunity and experts collaborated on a systematic vision of how to use big data both to improve the granularity of information for place-based study and to efficiently translate health disparities research into improved population health. This Narrative Review is the result of that collaboration. <b>Results:</b> Big data could enhance the process of translating scientific findings into reduced health disparities by contributing information at fine spatial and temporal scales suited to interventions. In addition, big data could fill pressing needs for health care system, genomic, and social determinant data to understand mechanisms. Finally, big data could lead to appropriately personalized health care for demographic groups. Rich new resources, including social media, electronic health records, sensor information from digital devices, and crowd-sourced and citizen-collected data, have the potential to complement more traditional data from health surveys, administrative data, and investigator-initiated registries or cohorts. This Narrative Review argues for a renewed focus on translational research cycles to accomplish this continual assessment. <b>Conclusion:</b> The promise of big data extends from etiology research to the evaluation of large-scale interventions and offers the opportunity to accelerate translation of health disparities studies. This data-rich world for health disparities research, however, will require continual assessment for efficacy, ethical rigor, and potential algorithmic or system bias."
"Disparities in breast cancer diagnosis are established. In usual practice, biopsies are performed days or weeks after recommendation. Our aim was to measure the impact of a same-day biopsy program on disparities in time from biopsy recommendation to performance.','After Institutional Review Board approval, we identified all diagnostic examinations leading to biopsy pre- (September 2016 to March 2017) and post- (September 2017 to March 2018) implementation of our same-day biopsy program. We compared demographic characteristics (age, race, language, and insurance) and biopsy information (days from biopsy recommendation to biopsy, and proportion of same-day biopsies in all biopsies) in pre- versus postimplementation groups. Multivariable linear and logistic models in pre- and postimplementation groups assessed if days from biopsy recommendation to biopsy and having a same-day biopsy were associated with patient subgroups.','In all, 663 and 482 patients underwent biopsy during pre- and postimplementation periods, respectively. Patient subgroups were similar between periods. For all patients, the same-day biopsy program decreased median time from diagnostic examination to biopsy from 8 (interquartile range: 4-13) to 0 (interquartile range: 0-4) days (P < .001). During the pre-implementation period, nonwhite patients and having Medicare insurance were associated with longer days to biopsy (nonwhite Adjusted Coefficient: 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-4.03; insurance Adjusted Coefficient: 2.47, 95% CI: 0.58-4.37; P < .05), after adjustment. During the postimplementation period, the previously seen disparities did not persist (nonwhite Adjusted Coefficient: -0.416, 95% CI: -2.16-1.33; insurance Adjusted Coefficient: 0.812, 95% CI: -1.18-2.80; P > .05).','There was no evidence of racial/ethnic or insurance disparities in time from biopsy recommendation to performance after implementation of a same-day biopsy program."
"Prior studies have identified smoking as a key driver of socioeconomic disparities in U.S. mortality, but the growing drug epidemic leads us to question whether drug abuse is exacerbating those disparities, particularly for mortality from external causes. We use data from a national survey of midlife Americans to evaluate socioeconomic disparities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality over an 18-year period (1995-2013). Then, we use marginal structural modeling to quantify the indirect effects of smoking and alcohol/drug abuse in mediating those disparities. Our results demonstrate that alcohol/drug abuse makes little contribution to socioeconomic disparities in all-cause mortality, probably because the prevalence of substance abuse is low and socioeconomic differences in abuse are small, especially at older ages when most Americans die. Smoking prevalence is much higher than drug/alcohol abuse and socioeconomic differentials in smoking are large and have widened among younger cohorts. Not surprisingly, smoking accounts for the majority (62%) of the socioeconomic disparity in mortality from smoking-related diseases, but smoking also makes a substantial contribution to cardiovascular (38%) and all-cause mortality (34%). Based on the observed cohort patterns of smoking, we predict that smoking will further widen SES disparities in all-cause mortality until at least 2045 for men and even later for women. Although we cannot yet determine the mortality consequences of recent widening of the socioeconomic disparities in drug abuse, social inequalities in mortality are likely to grow even wider over the coming decades as the legacy of smoking and the recent drug epidemic take their toll."
"Systemic racism is a public health crisis. Systemic racism and racial/ethnic injustice produce racial/ethnic disparities in health care and health. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities in stroke care and health exist and result predominantly from unequal treatment. This special report aims to summarize selected interventions to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in stroke prevention and treatment. It reviews the social determinants of health and the determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in care. It provides a focused summary of selected interventions aimed at reducing stroke risk factors, increasing awareness of stroke symptoms, and improving access to care for stroke because these interventions hold the promise of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in stroke death rates. It also discusses knowledge gaps and future directions."
"To determine racial/ethnic disparities in weekly counts of new COVID-19 cases and deaths among nursing home residents or staff.','Cross-sectional analysis of national nursing home COVID-19 reports linked to other data. Multivariable two-part models modeled disparities in count of cases or deaths, and logistic regressions modeled disparities in self-reported shortages in staff and personal protective equipment (PPE), across nursing home groups with varying proportions of racial/ethnic minority residents, defined as low-, medium-, medium-high-, and high-proportion groups.','A total of 12,576 nursing homes nationally.','None.','None.','Numbers of incident COVID-19 confirmed cases among residents and staff, and incident COVID-19 related deaths among residents (primary outcomes); and nursing home reported shortages in staff and PPE (secondary outcomes). All outcomes were reported for the week of May 25, 2020.','The number of weekly new COVID-19 confirmed cases among residents ranged from an average of 0.4 cases per facility (standard deviation (SD) = 2.5) for the low-proportion group (93.0% had zero new cases) to 1.5 cases per facility (SD = 6.3) for the high-proportion group (78.9% had zero new cases). Multivariable regression estimated that compared with the low-proportion group, the likelihood of having at least one new resident case was 76% higher (odds ratio = 1.76; 95% confidence interval = 1.38-2.25; P = .000) for the high-proportion group. Similar across-facility disparities were found for the weekly count of new COVID-19 deaths among residents (ranging from 0.1 deaths per facility (SD = 1.1) for the low-proportion group to 0.4 deaths (SD = 2.0) for the high-proportion group) and in the weekly count of new COVID-19 confirmed cases among staff (ranging from 0.3 cases (SD = 1.4] to 1.3 cases (SD = 4.4) per facility). No substantial disparities in self-reported shortages of staff or PPE were found.','Nursing homes caring for disproportionately more racial/ethnic minority residents reported more weekly new COVID-19 confirmed cases and/or deaths. Immediate actions are needed to address these system-level disparities."
"Health disparities are pervasive in nursing homes (NHs), but disparities in NH end-of-life (EOL) care (ie, hospital transfers, place of death, hospice use, palliative care, advance care planning) have not been comprehensively synthesized. We aim to identify differences in NH EOL care for racial/ethnic minority residents.','A systematic review guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181792).','Older NH residents who were terminally ill or approaching the EOL, including racial/ethnic minority NH residents.','Three electronic databases were searched from 2010 to May 2020. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.','Eighteen articles were included, most (n = 16) were good quality and most (n = 15) used data through 2010. Studies varied in definitions and grouping of racial/ethnic minority residents. Four outcomes were identified: advance care planning (n = 10), hospice (n = 8), EOL hospitalizations (n = 6), and pain management (n = 1). Differences in EOL care were most apparent among NHs with higher proportions of Black residents. Racial/ethnic minority residents were less likely to complete advance directives. Although hospice use was mixed, Black residents were consistently less likely to use hospice before death. Hispanic and Black residents were more likely to experience an EOL hospitalization compared with non-Hispanic White residents. Racial/ethnic minority residents experienced worse pain and symptom management at the EOL; however, no articles studied specifics of palliative care (eg, spiritual care).','This review identified NH health disparities in advance care planning, EOL hospitalizations, and pain management for racial/ethnic minority residents. Research is needed that uses recent data, reflective of current NH demographic trends. To help reduce EOL disparities, language services and cultural competency training for staff should be available in NHs with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minorities."
"To summarize the current literature on disparities in the treatment of chronic pain.','We focused on studies conducted in the United States and published from 2000 and onward. Studies of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and interventional designs were included.','A review of the current literature revealed that an adverse association between non-White race and treatment of chronic pain is well supported. Studies have also shown that racial differences exist in the long-term monitoring for opioid misuse among patients suffering from chronic pain. In addition, a patient's sociodemographic profile appears to influence the relationship between chronic pain and quality of life. Results from interventional studies were mixed.','Disparities exist within the treatment of chronic pain. Currently, it is unclear how to best combat these disparities. Further work is needed to understand why disparities exist and to identify points in patients' treatment when they are most vulnerable to unequal care. Such work will help guide the development and implementation of effective interventions."
"Racial and socioeconomic disparities in health access and outcomes for many conditions is well known. However, for time-sensitive high-acuity diseases such as traumatic injuries, disparities in access and outcomes should be significantly diminished. Our primary objective was to characterize racial disparities across majority, mixed-race, and minority hospitals for African American ([AA] vs White) males with high-grade splenic injuries.','Data from the National Trauma Data Bank were utilized from 2007 to 2015; 24 855 AA or White males with high-grade splenic injuries were included. Multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis was used to evaluate disparities in outcomes and resource allocation.','Mortality was significantly higher for AA males at mixed-race (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.3-2.1; <i>P</i> < .001) and minority (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.5-3.0; <i>P</i> < .001) hospitals, but not at majority hospitals. At minority hospitals, AA males were significantly less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (OR 0.7; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97; <i>P</i> = .04) and experienced a significantly longer time to surgery (IRR 1.5; <i>P</i> = .02). Minority hospitals were significantly more likely to have failures from angiographic embolization requiring operative intervention (OR 2.2, <i>P</i> = .009). At both types of nonmajority hospitals, AA males with penetrating injuries were more likely to be managed with angiography (mixed-race hospitals: OR 1.7; <i>P</i> = .046 vs minority hospitals: OR 1.6; <i>P</i> = .08).','While multiple studies have shown that minority hospitals have increased mortality compared to majority hospitals, this study found this disparity only existed for AAs."
"Systemic inequity in biometrics systems based on racial and gender disparities has received a lot of attention recently. These disparities have been explored in existing biometrics systems such as facial biometrics (identifying individuals based on facial attributes). However, such ethical issues remain largely unexplored in voice biometric systems that are very popular and extensively used globally. Using a corpus of non-speech voice records featuring a diverse group of 300 speakers by race (75 each from White, Black, Asian, and Latinx subgroups) and gender (150 each from female and male subgroups), we explore and reveal that racial subgroup has a similar voice characteristic and gender subgroup has a significant different voice characteristic. Moreover, non-negligible racial and gender disparities exist in speaker identification accuracy by analyzing the performance of one commercial product and five research products. The average accuracy for Latinxs can be 12% lower than Whites (p < 0.05, 95% CI 1.58%, 14.15%) and can be significantly higher for female speakers than males (3.67% higher, p < 0.05, 95% CI 1.23%, 11.57%). We further discover that racial disparities primarily result from the neural network-based feature extraction within the voice biometric product and gender disparities primarily due to both voice inherent characteristic difference and neural network-based feature extraction. Finally, we point out strategies (e.g., feature extraction optimization) to incorporate fairness and inclusive consideration in biometrics technology."
"Recognizing health disparities among children with cerebral palsy (CP) is necessary for understanding potential risk factors for CP and for implementing early and effective preventative and intervention treatments. However, there is currently little and conflicting evidence regarding the direct impact of contextual factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) for children with CP in the United States. These contextual factors include the complex social determinants of health on prematurity, comprehensive informed obstetric management for minority and vulnerable populations, and cumulative adversity disproportionately experienced by children, by gender, minority status, immigration, poverty, and structural racism.','This study presents results from a review of health disparities among children with CP, using registry and population surveillance data from Australia, Canada, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Turkey, and the United States.','The review confirmed that there are significant health disparities among children with CP, both in terms of prevalence and severity, based on factors such as SES, neighborhood disadvantage, maternal education, gender, and minority status.','Strategies need to be implemented in the United States to promote enablement and functioning among children with CP who face additional health disparities. This requires a greater understanding of population groups at increased risk, comprehensive assessment and care for young children with motor delays, and systematic population counts of children and adults with CP using registries and systems of neurodevelopmental surveillance across health, education, and community rehabilitation. These efforts also require sensitivity to structural and persistent racism, stigma, trauma-informed care, and culturally sensitive community engagement. Additional efforts are also required to improve outcomes over the life course for individuals living a life with CP from a framework of enablement, self-direction, equity and social justice."
"Health disparities have become apparent since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When observing racial discrimination in healthcare, self-reported incidences, and perceptions among minority groups in the United States suggest that, the most socioeconomically underrepresented groups will suffer disproportionately in COVID-19 due to synergistic mechanisms. This study reports racially-stratified data regarding the experiences and impacts of different groups availing the healthcare system to identify disparities in outcomes of minority and majority groups in the United States.','Studies were identified utilizing PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO search engines without date and language restrictions. The following keywords were used: Healthcare, raci*, ethnic*, discriminant, hosti*, harass*, insur*, education, income, psychiat*, COVID-19, incidence, mortality, mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was conducted in Review Manager (RevMan V.5.4). Unadjusted Odds Ratios, <i>P</i>-values, and 95% confidence intervals were presented.','Discrimination in the United States is evident among racial groups regarding medical care portraying mental risk behaviors as having serious outcomes in the health of minority groups. The perceived health inequity had a low association to the majority group as compared to the minority group (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.78; <i>P</i> = .007), and the association of mental health problems to the Caucasian-American majority group was low (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.58; <i>P</i> < .001).','As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery."
"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapies are used in the management of patients with complex regional pain syndrome I (CRPS I) and failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the racial and health insurance inequalities with SCS therapy in patients with chronic pain who had CRPS I and FBSS.','Patients with chronic pain who had a discharge diagnosis of FBSS and CRPS I were identified using the National Inpatient Sample database. Our primary outcome was defined as the history of SCS utilization by race/ethnicity, income quartile, and insurance status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the variables associated with utilization of SCS therapy.','Between 2011 and 2015, 40,858 patients who were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of FBSS and/or CRPS I were identified. Of these patients, 1,082 (2.7%) had a history of SCS therapy. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that compared to White patients, Black and Hispanic patients had higher odds of having SCS therapy (Black patients: odds ratio [OR] = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 1.77; P = 0.003; Hispanic patients: OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.81; P = 0.007). Patients with private insurance had significantly higher odds of having SCS therapy compared with those with Medicare (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.43; P = 0.003). Compared to patients with Medicare, Medicaid patients had lower odds of having SCS therapy (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.70; P < 0.001).','Our study suggests that socioeconomic disparities may exist in the utilization of SCS among hospitalized patients with CRPS I and FBSS the United States. However, confirming these data from other administrative databases, in the outpatient setting, may shed more insight."
"Indicators based a fixed ""old"" age threshold have been widely used for assessing socioeconomic disparities in mortality at older ages. Interpretation of long-term trends and determinants of these indicators is challenging because mortality above a fixed age that in the past would have reflected old age deaths is today mixing premature and old-age mortality. We propose the modal (i.e., most frequent) age at death, M, an indicator increasingly recognized in aging research, but which has been infrequently used for monitoring mortality disparities at older ages. We use mortality and population exposure data by occupational class over the 1971-2017 period from Finnish register data. The modal age and life expectancy indicators are estimated from mortality rates smoothed with penalized B-splines. Over the 1971-2017 period, occupational class disparities in life expectancy at 65 and 75 widened while disparities in M remained relatively stable. The proportion of the group surviving to the modal age was constant across time and occupational class. In contrast, the proportion surviving to age 65 and 75 has roughly doubled since 1971 and showed strong occupational class differences. Increasing socioeconomic disparities in mortality based on fixed old age thresholds may be a feature of changing selection dynamics in a context of overall declining mortality. Unlike life expectancy at a selected fixed old age, M compares individuals with similar survival chances over time and across occupational classes. This property makes trends and differentials in M easier to interpret in countries where old-age survival has improved significantly."
"COVID-19 racial disparities have gained significant attention yet little is known about how age distributions obscure racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 case fatality ratios (CFR).','We filled this gap by assessing relevant data availability and quality across states, and in states with available data, investigating how racial-ethnic disparities in CFR changed after age adjustment. Design/Setting/Participants/Exposure: We conducted a landscape analysis as of July 1st, 2020 and developed a grading system to assess COVID-19 case and death data by age and race in 50 states and DC. In states where age- and race-specific data were available, we applied direct age standardization to compare CFR across race-ethnicities. We developed an online dashboard to automatically and continuously update our results. Main Outcome and Measure: Our main outcome was CFR (deaths per 100 confirmed cases). We examined CFR by age and race-ethnicities.','We found substantial variations in disaggregating and reporting case and death data across states. Only three states, California, Illinois and Ohio, had sufficient age- and race-ethnicity-disaggregation to allow the investigation of racial-ethnic disparities in CFR while controlling for age. In total, we analyzed 391,991confirmed cases and 17,612 confirmed deaths. The crude CFRs varied from, e.g. 7.35% among Non-Hispanic (NH) White population to 1.39% among Hispanic population in Ohio. After age standardization, racial-ethnic differences in CFR narrowed, e.g. from 5.28% among NH White population to 3.79% among NH Asian population in Ohio, or an over one-fold difference. In addition, the ranking of race-ethnic-specific CFRs changed after age standardization. NH White population had the leading crude CFRs whereas NH Black and NH Asian population had the leading and second leading age-adjusted CFRs respectively in two of the three states. Hispanic populations age-adjusted CFR were substantially higher than the crude. Sensitivity analysis did not change these results qualitatively.','The availability and quality of age- and race-ethnic-specific COVID-19 case and death data varied greatly across states. Age distributions in confirmed cases obscured racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 CFR. Age standardization narrows racial-ethnic disparities and changes ranking. Public COVID-19 data availability, quality, and harmonization need improvement to address racial disparities in this pandemic."
"Race and ethnicity-based disparities in childhood asthma are well established. We characterized the longitudinal effects associated with being African-American/Black or Hispanic/Latino on a range of asthma outcomes, and the extent to which sociodemographic factors, caregiver health literacy, education level, and asthma knowledge mediate these associations.','Children ages 8-15 and their caregivers (n = 544) in the Chicago Initiative to Raise Asthma Health Equity (CHIRAH) cohort completed interviews every 3 months for 1.5 years. Health literacy was measured with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Other covariates include sex, age, education level, income, smoke exposure, asthma duration, employment status, and insurance status. We conducted a series of models to evaluate these factors as mediators of the relationship between race/ethnicity and (1) asthma knowledge, (2) asthma-related quality of life, (3) asthma severity, and (4) asthma control based on NAEPP/EPR-3 2007 guidelines.','African-American race and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity were significantly associated with all outcomes when compared to Whites. Adjusting for sociodemographic factors resulted in the most significant mediation of racial/ethnic disparities in all outcomes. Health literacy was a partial mediator of race/ethnic disparities in asthma knowledge and asthma-related quality of life. Asthma knowledge remained significantly associated with race and ethnicity, and race remained associated with asthma-related quality of life.','African-American race and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are significantly associated with worse asthma compared to Whites in longitudinal analyses. Sociodemographic factors are potent mediators of these disparities, and should be considered when designing interventions to reduce asthma disparities. Health literacy and education level are partial mediators."
"To evaluate whether non-adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines and other factors related to treatment access contribute to racial disparities in ovarian cancer survival.','This large cohort study included patients from the National Cancer Database who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2004 and 2014, with follow-up data up to 2017. The multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the effect of study variables on five-year overall survival. The proportion contributions of prognostic factors to the survival disparities were estimated using individual and sequential adjustment of these factors based on the Cox proportional hazards models.','Of the 120,712 patients eligible for this study, 110,032 (91.1%) were whites and 10,680 (8.9%) were blacks. Black patients, compared with their white counterparts, had a lower adherence to NCCN guidelines (60.8% vs. 70.4%, respectively, P < 0.001), and a higher five-year mortality after cancer diagnosis (age- and tumor characteristics- adjusted hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.25). Non-adherence to NCCN treatment guidelines was the most significant contributor to racial disparity in ovarian cancer survival, followed by access to care and comorbidity, each explaining 36.4%, 22.7%, and 18.2% of the racial differences in five-year overall survival, respectively. These factors combined explain 59.1% of racial survival disparities. Risk factors identified for non-adherence to treatment guidelines among blacks include insurance status, treatment facility type, educational attainment, age, and comorbidity.','Adherence status to NCCN treatment guidelines is the most important contributor to the survival disparities between black and white patients with ovarian cancer. Our findings call for measures to promote equitable access to guideline-adherence care to improve the survival of black women with ovarian cancer."
"Since implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, more Americans have health insurance, and many racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare have improved. We previously reported that Black and Hispanic patients undergo surgery for spinal stenosis at lower rates than do white patients.','To assess changes in racial/ethnic disparities in rates of lumbar spinal surgery after passage of the ACA.','Retrospective analysis.','Approximately 3.2 million adults who underwent lumbar spinal surgery in the US from 2006 through 2014.','Racial disparities in discharge rates before versus after ACA passage.','Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey Supplement, and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, criteria for definite lumbar spinal surgery, we calculated rates of lumbar spinal surgery as the number of hospital discharges divided by population estimates and stratified patients by race/ethnicity after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Calendar years were stratified as before ACA passage (2006-2010) or after ACA passage (2011-2014). Poisson regression was used to model hospital discharge rates as a function of race/ethnicity before and after ACA passage after adjustment for potential confounders.','All rates are expressed per 1,000 persons. The overall median discharge rate decreased from 1.9 before ACA passage to 1.6 after ACA passage (p < .001). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, the Black:White disparity in discharge rates decreased from 0.40:1 before ACA to 0.44:1 after ACA (p < .001). A similar decrease in the Hispanic:White disparity occurred, from 0.35:1 before ACA to 0.38:1 after ACA (p < .001).','Small but significant decreases occurred in racial/ethnic disparities in hospital discharge rates for lumbar spinal surgery after ACA passage."
"Racial disparities in colorectal surgery outcomes have been studied extensively in the USA, and access to healthcare resources may contribute to these differences. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated healthcare network in the USA with the potential for equal access care to veterans. The objective of this study is to evaluate the VHA for the presence of racial disparities in 30-day outcomes of patients that underwent colorectal resection.','Colon and rectal resections from 2008 to 2019 were reviewed retrospectively using the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Patients were categorized by race and ethnicity. Multivariable analysis was used to compare 30-day outcomes. Cases with ""unknown/other/declined to answer"" race/ethnicity were excluded.','Thirty-six-thousand-nine-hundred-sixty-nine cases met inclusion criteria: 27,907 (75.5%) Caucasian, 6718 (18.2%) African American, 2047 (5.5%) Hispanic, and 290 (0.8%) Native American patients. There were no statistically significant differences in overall complication incidence or mortality between all cohorts. Compared to Caucasian race, African American patients had longer mean length of stay (10.7 days vs. 9.7 days; p < 0.001). Compared to Caucasian race, Hispanic patients had higher odds of pulmonary-specific complications (adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval = 1.39 [1.17-1.64]; p < 0.001).','The VHA provides the benefits of integrated healthcare and access, which may explain the improvements in racial disparities compared to existing literature. However, some racial disparities in clinical outcomes still persisted in this analysis. Further efforts beyond healthcare access are needed to mitigate disparities in colorectal surgery.

"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience increased morbidity and decreased life expectancy compared to the general population, and these disparities are likely exacerbated for those individuals who are otherwise disadvantaged. We conducted a review to ascertain what is known about health and health system quality (e.g., high quality care delivery, adequate care access) disparities in ASD. Nine studies met final inclusion criteria. Seven studies identified racial disparities in access to general medical services for children with ASD. No studies examined disparities in health outcomes or included older adults. We present a model of health disparities (Fundamental Causes Model) that guides future research. Additional work should examine health disparities, and their causal pathways, in ASD, particularly for older adults."
"The objective of this study is to measure racial and ethnic disparities in autism-related services among U.S. children with parent-reported autism spectrum disorder (ASD).','Using the 2011 Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Services, we analyzed parent-reported data on 1420 children with current ASD in the nationally representative sample. An estimation method consistent with the Institute of Medicine's definition of health care disparities is used to measure racial and ethnic disparities.','The findings revealed Latino-white disparities in the percentage of children currently using school-based occupational and physical therapy and Latino-white and ""other race""-white disparities in the percentage of children using physical therapy outside of school. There were no statistically significant black-white disparities. Instead, the study found that the percentage of black children with ASD receiving school-based services was 8 points higher than that of white children (p < 0.04). Factors unrelated to the need for autism services were largely unassociated with the receipt of services.','The findings provide a partial baseline and identify a need for further examination of the source of existing disparities and the lack of disparities found for specific services and minority groups."
"Reducing health disparities in rural communities of color remains a national concern. Efforts to reduce health disparities often center on community engagement, which is historically the strategy used to provide rural minority populations with support to access and utilize health information and services. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), with their origins derived from social injustices and discrimination, are uniquely positioned to conduct this type of engagement. We present the ""Research with Care"" project, a long-standing positive working relationship between North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and rural Halifax County, North Carolina, demonstrating an effective campus-community partnership. The importance of readiness to implement Community-based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles is underscored. As demonstrated by the NCCU-Halifax partnership, we recommend leveraging the positive associations of the HBCU brand identity as a method of building and sustaining meaningful relationships with rural Black communities. This underscores the role and value of HBCUs in the health disparities research arena and should be communicated and embraced."
"Structural racism has been and remains a fundamental cause of persistent health disparities in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and multiple others have been reminders that structural racism persists and restricts the opportunities for long, healthy lives of Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The American Heart Association has previously published statements addressing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk and disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, but these statements have not adequately recognized structural racism as a fundamental cause of poor health and disparities in cardiovascular disease. This presidential advisory reviews the historical context, current state, and potential solutions to address structural racism in our country. Several principles emerge from our review: racism persists; racism is experienced; and the task of dismantling racism must belong to all of society. It cannot be accomplished by affected individuals alone. The path forward requires our commitment to transforming the conditions of historically marginalized communities, improving the quality of housing and neighborhood environments of these populations, advocating for policies that eliminate inequities in access to economic opportunities, quality education, and health care, and enhancing allyship among racial and ethnic groups. Future research on racism must be accelerated and should investigate the joint effects of multiple domains of racism (structural, interpersonal, cultural, anti-Black). The American Heart Association must look internally to correct its own shortcomings and advance antiracist policies and practices regarding science, public and professional education, and advocacy. With this advisory, the American Heart Association declares its unequivocal support of antiracist principles."
"Pulmonary health disparities disproportionately impact disadvantaged and vulnerable populations. This article focuses on disparities in disease prevalence, morbidity, and mortality for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumoconiosis, and lung cancer. Disparities are categorized by race, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. Each category highlights differences in risk factors for the development and severity of lung disease. Risk factors include social, behavioral, economic, and biologic determinants of health (occupational/environmental exposures, psychosocial stressors, smoking, health literacy, health care provider bias, and health care access). Many of these risk factors are complex and inter-related; strategies proposed to decrease disparities require multilevel approaches."
"We previously reported improved outcomes after implementing the electronic-AsthmaTracker (e-AT), a self-monitoring tool for children with asthma, at 11 ambulatory pediatric clinics. This study assesses e-AT adherence and impact across race/ethnicity subgroups.','Secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study of children ages 2-17 years with persistent asthma, enrolled from January 2014 to December 2015 to use the e-AT for 1 year. Survival analysis was used to compare e-AT use adherence and generalized estimating equation models to compare outcomes pre- and post e-AT initiation, between race/ethnicity subgroups.','Data from 318 children with baseline measurements were analyzed: 76.4 % white, 11.3 % Hispanic, 7.8 % ""other"", and 4.4 % unknown race/ethnicity subgroups. Mean e-AT adherence was 82 % (95 %CI: 79-84 %, reference) for whites, 73 % (64-81 %, p = 0.025) for Hispanics, and 78 % (69-86 %, p = 0.373) for other minorities. Compared to whites, Cox proportional hazard ratio for study dropout risk was 2.14 (1.31-3.77, p = 0.001) for Hispanics and 0.95 (0.60-1.50, p = 0.834) for other minorities. Disparities existed at baseline, with lower QOL (74.9 vs 80.6; p = 0.025) and asthma control (18.4 vs 19.7; p = 0.027) among Hispanics, compared to whites. After e-AT initiation, disparities disappeared at 3 months for QOL (87.2 vs 90.5; p = 0.159) and asthma control (23.1 vs 22.4; p = 0.063), persisting until study end. Disparities also existed at baseline, with lower QOL (74.6 vs. 80.6; p = 0.042) and asthma control (18.2 vs. 19.7, p = 0.024) among ""other"" minorities, compared to whites, and disappeared at 3 months for QOL (92.7 vs. 90.5, p = 0.432) and asthma control (22.7 vs 22.4; p = 0.518), persisting until study end. Subgroup analysis was underpowered to detect a difference in oral steroid use or ED/hospital admissions.','Our study shows improved asthma control and QOL among minorities and disparity elimination after e-AT implementation. Future adequately powered studies will explore the impact on oral steroid and ED/hospital use disparities."
"There is a well-established association between multiple sociodemographic risk factors and disparities in cancer care. These risk factors include minority race and ethnicity, low socioeconomic status (SES) including low income and education level, non-English primary language, immigrant status, and residential segregation, and distance to facilities that deliver cancer care. As cancer care advances, existing disparities in screening, treatment, and outcomes have become more evident. Lung cancer remains the most common and fatal malignancy in the United States, with breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer being the three most common and deadly extrathoracic malignancies. Achieving the best outcomes for patients with these malignancies relies on strong physician-patient relationships leading to robust screening, early diagnosis, and early referral to facilities that can deliver multidisciplinary care and multimodal therapy. It is likely that challenges experienced in developing patient trust and understanding, providing access to screening, and building referral pipelines for definitive therapy in lung cancer care to vulnerable populations are paralleled by those in extrathoracic malignancies. Likewise, progress made in delivering optimal care to all patients across sociodemographic and geographic barriers can serve as a roadmap. Therefore, we provide a narrative review of current disparities in screening, treatment, and outcomes for patients with breast, prostate, and colorectal malignancies."
"The present study examined racial/ethnic disparities in initial treatment episode completion for adult clients reporting opioids as their primary problem substance in large US metropolitan areas.','Data were extracted from the 2013 TEDS-D dataset (Treatment Episode Dataset-Discharge) for the 42 largest US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Fixed effects logistic regression controlling for MSA was used to estimate the effect of race/ethnicity on the likelihood of treatment completion. The model was repeated for each individual MSA in a stratified design to compare the geographic variation in racial/ethnic disparities, controlling for gender, age, education, employment, living arrangement, treatment setting, medication-assisted treatment, referral source, route of administration, and number of substances used at admission.','Only 28% of clients completed treatment, and the results from the fixed effects model indicate that blacks and Hispanics are less likely to complete treatment compared to whites. However, the stratified analysis of individual MSAs found only three of the 42 MSAs had racial/ethnic disparities in treatment completion, with the New York City (NYC) MSA largely responsible for the disparities in the combined sample. Supplementary analyses suggest that there are greater differences between whites and minority clients in the NYC MSA vs. other cities on characteristics associated with treatment completion (e.g., residential treatment setting).','This study underscores the need for improving treatment retention for all opioid using clients in large metropolitan areas in the US, particularly for minority clients in those localities where disparities exist, and for better understanding the geographic context for treatment outcomes."
"<i>Background:</i> Compared to heterosexual adults, lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults have higher rates of <i>any</i> illicit drug use and <i>any</i> prescription drug misuse, yet disparities regarding specific drugs remain poorly characterized. <i>Methods:</i> We examined disparities by sexual identity and sex for 8 illicit and prescription drugs using 2015-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data. Outcomes included past-year use/misuse of cocaine/crack, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, heroin, prescription opioids, prescription stimulants, prescription tranquilizers/sedatives, and level of polydrug use/misuse (2 substances; 3+ substances). For each outcome, odds ratios relative to heterosexual adults of same sex were estimated using logistic regression controlling for demographics; significant estimates were interpreted as a disparity. <i>Results:</i> Among gay men, significant disparities were present for all drugs except prescription stimulants and heroin; inhalant use was particularly elevated. Bisexual women exhibited significant disparities for every drug examined, as did bisexual men (except heroin). Among lesbian/gay women, disparities were only present for prescription opioids and stimulants. Relative to heterosexual peers, use of 3+ substances was 3 times higher among gay men and bisexual women and 2 times higher among bisexual men. <i>Conclusions:</i> Consistent with minority stress theory, prevalences of illicit and prescription drug use/misuse were 2-3 times higher among LGB adults than heterosexual adults. Illicit drug use should not be perceived as only impacting gay/bisexual men - bisexual women had similar - or higher - prevalences of hallucinogen, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin use. Yet, in contrast to bisexual women, lesbian/gay women did not exhibit disparities for any illicit drugs."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in adults' access to dental care have persisted for decades. We examined how recent Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansions that included coverage of dental services for adults affected racial and ethnic disparities in dental services use. Using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from the period 2011-18, we compared changes in dental services use for low-income non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults with changes in use for low-income non-Hispanic White adults. We found that expansions including extensive dental benefits were associated with narrowed racial and ethnic disparities in dental care visits and use of preventive and treatment services. For non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults, after Medicaid expansion with extensive dental benefits there was an 8-percentage-point increase in their likelihood of dental visits in a given year when compared with non-Hispanic White adults. This represents a reduction from preexpansion disparities by 75 percent for non-Hispanic Black adults and 50 percent for Hispanic adults. This disparity decline is due to both an increase in dental services use among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults and little change occurring among non-Hispanic White adults. In contrast, no decline in disparities was seen in states with less generous dental benefits. Overall, rates of dental care among low-income adults continue to be low across racial and ethnic groups, indicating other key access barriers to dental care and persistent unmet oral health needs."
"Racial disparities in the United States healthcare system are well described across a variety of clinical settings. The ICU is a clinical environment with a higher acuity and mortality rate, potentially compounding the impact of disparities on patients. We sought to systematically analyze the literature to assess the prevalence of racial disparities in the ICU.','We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library.','We identified articles that evaluated racial differences on outcomes among ICU patients in the United States. Two authors independently screened and selected articles for inclusion.','We dual-extracted study characteristics and outcomes that assessed for disparities in care (e.g., in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay). Studies were assessed for bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.','Of 1,325 articles screened, 25 articles were included (n = 751,796 patients). Studies demonstrated race-based differences in outcomes, including higher mortality rates for Black patients when compared with White patients. However, when controlling for confounding variables, such as severity of illness and hospital type, mortality differences based on race were no longer observed. Additionally, results revealed that Black patients experienced greater financial impacts during an ICU admission, were less likely to receive early tracheostomy, and were less likely to receive timely antibiotics than White patients. Many studies also observed differences in patients' end-of-life care, including lower rates on the quality of dying, less advanced care planning, and higher intensity of interventions at the end of life for Black patients.','This systematic review found significant differences in the care and outcomes among ICU patients of different races. Mortality differences were largely explained by accompanying demographic and patient factors, highlighting the effect of structural inequalities on racial differences in mortality in the ICU. This systematic review provides evidence that structural inequalities in care persist in the ICU, which contribute to racial disparities in care. Future research should evaluate interventions to address inequality in the ICU."
"There is limited information on disparities of people with epilepsy (PWE) and, foremost, their caregivers. The objective of this study was to comprehensively compare between PWE and caregivers with low socioeconomic status (SES) and those with high SES for disparities in demographic and epilepsy characteristics, treatment and health care utilization, physical and psychosocial impact, and knowledge about epilepsy. PWE and caregivers completed surveys about the aforementioned outcomes during their epilepsy clinic visit or epilepsy monitoring unit admission. Associations were evaluated using SES as a binary independent variable and the patient and caregiver related outcomes as dependent variables. Thirty-eight patients with low SES and 88 patients with high SES were recruited. Patients with low SES were more commonly non-white, uninsured, unemployed, of lower educational attainment and living in larger households. They were more likely to visit the emergency room for their seizures, were more frequently on polypharmacy and experienced more AED adverse effects. They exhibited higher depression and anxiety levels and worse quality of life. Twenty-two caregivers with low SES and 66 caregivers of high SAS were recruited. Caregivers with low SES were more likely to be non-white and single. They manifested poorer knowledge about epilepsy. There are notable inequalities in demographic, treatment-related and health care utilization aspects of care of PWE, as well as in the psychosocial impact of their disease. Additional demographic and epilepsy knowledge-related disparities are recognized in caregivers of PWE. Identification of those disparities is a critical step in the creation of appropriate interventions to eliminate them."
"Rural populations in the United States are faced with a variety of health disparities that complicate access to care. Community health workers (CHWs) and their Spanish-speaking counterparts, <i>promotores de salud</i>, are well-equipped to address rural health access issues, provide education, and ultimately assuage these disparities. In this article, we compare community health workers in the states of Indiana and Texas, based on the results of two separate research studies, in order to (1) investigate the unique role of CHWs in rural communities and (2) understand how their advocacy efforts represent a central form of caregiving. Drawing on ethnographic, qualitative data-including interviews, photovoice, and participant observation-we analyze how CHWs connect structurally vulnerable clients in rural areas to resources, health education, and health and social services. Our primary contribution to existing scholarship on CHWs is the elaboration of advocacy as a form of caregiving to improve individual health outcomes as well as provoke structural change in the form of policy development. Finally, we describe how CHWs became especially critical in addressing disparities among rural populations in the wake of COVID-19, using their advocacy-as-caregiving role that was developed and well-established before the pandemic. These frontline workers are more vital than ever to address disparities and are a critical force in overcoming structural vulnerability and inequities in health in the United States."
"Health care disparities research is an exponentially growing and multi-faceted field. Our objective was to identify and analyze the top 100 cited articles in health care disparities. The authors searched the Thomas Reuters Web of Science for citations of all research papers (articles) relevant to health care disparities. After analyzing search results, the number of citations, authorship, year, journal, country of publication, institution of publication, and relevant topic were recorded for each article. The most cited article was Martin's 2002 work identifying the demography of incidence and occurrence of sepsis with specific analysis of race, sex, and disposition of US patients. The second most cited article was Kamangar's 2006 paper outlining geographic patterns in cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence. The third most cited article was Williams' 1996 study determining the differences in US health patterns in populations of different races and socioeconomic statuses through a review of similar studies. The majority of articles originated in the USA (91). The journal with the most published articles was JAMA-The Journal of the American Medical Association (14). The second most cited journal was The New England Journal of Medicine (7). Most articles were published in the 2000s (84). In descending order, the 3 most common topics were (1) disparities in cancer incidence, screening, treatment, and mortality, (2) disparities in mental health treatment, and (3) physician concordance, cultural competency, and relationships with minority patients. Overall, the highly cited articles contain current advancements in the body of knowledge used to resolve health care disparities in race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, age, wealth, education level, mental health, and geography throughout the world."
"Type 2 diabetes plays a major role in racial/ethnic health disparities. We conducted the first study to examine whether multifaceted interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HgbA1c >9%) can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes control. Among 4595 patients with diabetes at a Federally Qualified Health Center in New York, a higher percentage of blacks (32%) and Hispanics/Latinos (32%) had poorly controlled diabetes than whites (25%) at baseline (prevalence ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.14-1.43; P<0.001). After four years, this percentage was reduced in all groups (blacks, 21%; Hispanics/Latinos, 20%; whites, 20%; P<0.001 for each relative to baseline). Disparities in diabetes control also were significantly reduced (change in disparity relative to whites: blacks, P=0.03; Hispanics/Latinos, P=0.008). In this diverse population, interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled diabetes not only improved diabetes control in all racial/ethnic groups, but significantly reduced disparities. This approach warrants further testing and may help reduce disparities in other populations."
"Socioeconomic disparities in cancer survival have been reported in many developed countries, including Australia. Although some international studies have investigated the determinants of these socioeconomic disparities, most previous Australian studies have been descriptive, as only limited relevant data are generally available. Here, we describe a protocol for a study to use data from a large-scale Australian cohort linked with several other health-related databases to investigate several groups of factors associated with socioeconomic disparities in cancer survival in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and quantify their contributions to the survival disparities.','The Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study participants completed a baseline questionnaire during 2006-2009. Those who were subsequently diagnosed with cancer of the colon, rectum, lung or female breast will be included. This study sample will be identified by linkage with NSW Cancer Registry data for 2006-2013, and their vital status will be determined by linking with cause of death records up to 31 December 2015. The study cohort will be divided into four groups based on each of the individual education level and an area-based socioeconomic measure. The treatment received will be obtained through linking with hospital records and Medicare and pharmaceutical claims data. Cox proportional hazards models will be fitted sequentially to estimate the percentage contributions to overall socioeconomic survival disparities of patient factors, tumour and diagnosis factors, and treatment variables.','This research is covered by ethical approval from the NSW Population and Health Services Research Ethics Committee. Results of the study will be disseminated to different interest groups and organisations through scientific conferences, social media and peer-reviewed articles."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes of newborns requiring care in the NICU setting have been reported. The contribution of NICU care to disparities in outcomes is unclear.','To conduct a systematic review of the literature documenting racial/ethnic disparities in quality of care for infants in the NICU setting.','Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, and Web of Science were searched until March 6, 2018, by using search queries organized around the following key concepts: ""neonatal intensive care units,"" ""racial or ethnic disparities,"" and ""quality of care.""','English language articles up to March 6, 2018, that were focused on racial and/or ethnic differences in the quality of NICU care were selected.','Two authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and cross-checked results, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Information extracted focused on racial and/or ethnic disparities in quality of care and potential mechanism(s) for disparities.','Initial search yielded 566 records, 470 of which were unique citations. Title and abstract review resulted in 382 records. Appraisal of the full text of the remaining 88 records, along with the addition of 5 citations from expert consult or review of bibliographies, resulted in 41 articles being included.','Quantitative meta-analysis was not possible because of study heterogeneity.','Overall, this systematic review revealed complex racial and/or ethnic disparities in structure, process, and outcome measures, most often disadvantaging infants of color, especially African American infants. There are some exceptions to this pattern and each area merits its own analysis and discussion."
"To measure the frequency and nature of student-perceived clinician-driven health care disparities, and determine their impact on medical students' professional development.','Retrospective study of fourth-year medical students at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, August 2016 to June 2017. Conducted via an electronic survey asking about frequency/nature of directly witnessed health care disparities and barriers/facilitators to action during third-year clerkships; and individual, semistructured interviews focusing on clinical details and impact on students' professional development.','Respondents were 103/159 students (65%). In internal medicine clerkships, a majority perceived disparities as occurring sometimes (2-7 times in eight-week clerkship) or often (at least once weekly or nearly daily) based on language barriers (90%), patients' homelessness (77%), history of substance abuse (76%), obesity (67%), and race/ethnicity: Latino (72%), black (71%), and Asian (56%). Results from other clerkships were similar. Barriers to student action to perceived disparities included fear of poor evaluations, hierarchy/powerlessness, a ""don't speak up"" culture, the desire to be a team player, limited clinical experience, and perceiving doctors as ""good people"" who provide disparate care unintentionally. Impact on professional development varied, ranging from students' normalization of disparities as stemming from clinical constraints to increased motivation to provide equitable care.','Medical students routinely witness health care disparities during clerkships, and their observations spotlight specific clinical practices. For some students, these observations lead to a normalization of disparities; for others, they heighten commitment to equity. Clinical curricula should incorporate responding to health care disparities."
"Disparities in health and healthcare are widely documented for underrepresented racial and ethnic populations across a spectrum of diseases and care settings. An evidence base for addressing racial and ethnic disparities in health and healthcare requires investigators trained to conduct health disparities research.','To increase knowledge, stimulate interest, teach skills to evaluate and conduct, and foster collaborations in health disparities research.','We designed, implemented and evaluated a Health Disparities Research Curriculum (HDRC). Participants were early-stage investigators.','HDRC included twelve monthly sessions during 2015-2016. Instructors were mostly HDR investigators. Sessions combined didactic presentations, discussions, small group activities, and participant presentations.','Pre- and post-surveys to assess participants' perceptions of knowledge and skills.','Of 21 enrollees, 13 were from under-represented groups and 14 were women. Four reported some prior training in HDR, and 12 reported currently conducting HDR. Among the 12 participants who completed both the pre and post HDRC survey, initially the most commonly cited barriers to pursuing HDR were lack of knowledge (N = 6) and funding (N = 7). In the post-survey, the number citing lack of knowledge decreased (N = 2) and the number listing lack of funding increased (N = 9). There were increases in the number of participants reporting increased knowledge of HDR methods (pre-post: 4 vs. 8) and competence to design (3 vs. 7) and implement (2 vs. 9) HDR research.','The Duke HDRC augments efforts to reduce health disparities by providing training in HDR for young investigators. Our data indicate that the course was feasible, well-received, and increased perceived knowledge and competence. HDRC and similar courses may increase the quantity, quality and scope of HDR and thus move us closer to health equity."
"The purpose of this study was to assess trends in alcohol-related disparities between heterosexual and sexual minority adolescents in the United States from 2007 to 2015.','Data were pooled from the 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (N = 207,367) to estimate trends, disparities, and changes in disparities of four alcohol-related behaviors (i.e., lifetime alcohol use, early onset use (<13 years of age), past 30-day use, and past 30-day heavy episodic drinking [HED]) among heterosexual youth and three subgroups of sexual minority youth (SMY) (i.e., gay/lesbian, bisexual, and unsure). Models were sex stratified and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and state of data collection.','The prevalence of all alcohol-related behaviors declined from 2007 to 2015 for heterosexual youth, but not as consistently for SMY. Disparities in alcohol-related behaviors between heterosexual youth and SMY largely remained stable or widened from 2007 to 2015. Disparities in lifetime alcohol use and past 30-day use were larger between heterosexual boys and gay boys in 2015 relative to 2007. Disparities in early onset use and past 30-day HED were also larger between heterosexual girls and lesbian girls in 2015 relative to 2007. The disparity in past 30-day use between heterosexual girls and bisexual girls was smaller in 2015 compared with 2007.','Despite overall declines in adolescent alcohol use, alcohol-related disparities between heterosexual youth and SMY persist and, for some SMY, they have widened."
"There is empirical evidence that social determinants of health (SDOH) impact health outcomes in Black and Hispanic and Latinx individuals in the US. Recently, SDOH have risen to the top as essential intervention targets that could help alleviate racial and ethnic disparities. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) disproportionately affects Black individuals, and multiple sclerosis (MS) has seen a recent shift in select racial groups. It is unclear to what degree SDOH have been investigated and contribute to racial and ethnic health disparities and inequities.','This narrative review provides a contemporary synthesis of SDOH associated with racial and ethnic health disparities and inequities in MS, NMOSD, and other autoimmune disorders, such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-Ab)-associated disease. These immune-mediated neurological diseases were chosen for their capacity to be a high burden to society and because of complementary SDOH-associated challenges among minority populations. A paucity of research addressing inequities and the role of SDOH in MS and NMOSD was noted despite findings that Black individuals have a higher risk of developing MS or NMOSD and associated mortality compared with White individuals. Greater health disparities were also found for those with lower income and education, lower health literacy, and negative illness perceptions in MS. No studies in MOG-Ab disorders were found.','Increased efforts are needed to better understand the role of SDOH in racial and ethnic health disparities and inequities in MS, NMOSD, and emerging autoimmune disorders. This includes developing research frameworks aimed at understanding the magnitude and interrelationships of SDOH to better develop system-based multilevel interventions across the spectrum of care for these neurological conditions."
"There is growing evidence that rural and racial disparities and social determinants of health (SDOH) impact adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and overall maternal mortality in the United States. These APOs, such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction, are in-turn associated with increased risk of future cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. Importantly, SDOH such as socioeconomic disadvantages, poor health literacy, transportation barriers, lack of access to adequate health care, food insecurity, and psychosocial stressors have cascading effects on APOs and downstream cardiovascular health. These SDOH are also deeply intertwined with and compounded by existing racial and rural disparities. Pregnancy thus provides a unique opportunity to identify at-risk women from a social determinants perspective, and provide early interventions to optimize long-term CVD and mitigate cardiovascular health disparities. Addressing the challenges posed by these disparities requires a multi-pronged approach and involves national, regional, and individual level solutions. Eliminating disparities will necessitate a nationwide obligation to ensure health care equity via enhanced health insurance coverage, resource investment, and public and clinician accountability."
"Immersing students studying health promotion and disease prevention into community settings facing health disparities is an essential supplement to their academic experience. As part of many public health professions, these students will likely need to understand the values and beliefs of different cultures so that decisions of appropriate health promotion and treatment can be made equitably. This paper evaluates an education immersion program that was part of a National Cancer Institute funded collaboration supporting the recruitment and training of university students in cancer research. The primary aim of the Health Disparities Field Experience (HDFE) was to facilitate an experience for students pursuing a health-related degree to understand the conceptual issues in border/rural health and the cultural contexts related to health disparities among medically and financially indigent populations in the region.','This study was conducted using qualitative research methods using a variation of the content analysis approach using open codes to categorize the data. Six students were selected to participate in the HDFE (five graduate students and one undergraduate) and all six of the participants completed pre- and post-test surveys.','From the analysis of the data, posttest qualitative responses indicated that three participants saw racism as a primary cause of cancer-related disparities, a change from their pretest responses. When asked about the personal impact of the HDFE, respondents mentioned the importance of the experiential component.','Participants learned about health disparities from the HDFE and expressed high satisfaction with this approach to education."
"The U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative was launched nationally in February 2019. With a target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, EHE initially scales up effective HIV prevention and care in 57 localities that comprise the greatest proportion of annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (US). However, the EHE effort has been eclipsed by another infectious disease 11 months into the Initiative's implementation. SARS-COV-2, a novel coronavirus, has infected more than eight million Americans and at least 223 000 (as of 23 October 2020) have succumbed to the disease. This commentary explores the social conditions that place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV, and assesses challenges to EHE in a post-COVID-19 universe.','One of the many common threads between HIV and COVID-19 is the disproportionate impact of each disease among communities of colour. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences surmised that as much as 70% of health outcomes are due to health access, socio-economic factors and environmental conditions. Social determinants of health associated with greater HIV burden in Black and Brown communities have re-emerged in epidemiological studies of disproportionate COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in communities of colour. Using data from the scientific literature, this commentary makes direct comparisons between HIV and COVID-19 racial disparities across the social determinants of health. Furthermore, I examine three sets of challenges facing EHE: (1) Challenges that hamper both the EHE and COVID-19 response (i.e. insufficiently addressing the social determinants of health; amplification of disparities as new health technologies are introduced) (2) Challenges posed by COVID-19 (i.e. diverting HIV resources to address COVID-19 and tapering of EHE funding generally); and (3) Challenges unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e. emergence of new and related health disparities; repeal of the Affordable Care Act and long-term viability of EHE).','Racism and discrimination place communities of colour at greater risk for COVID-19 as well as HIV. Achieving and sustaining an end to the U.S. HIV epidemic will require structural change to eliminate conditions that give rise to and maintain disparities."
"Disparities in prevalence, disease severity, physical and mental morbidity, and mortality exist in childhood-onset systemic lupus (cSLE) that lead to worse outcomes in children with systemic lupus erythematosus from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Important gaps exist in knowledge regarding many individual race/ethnicities across the globe, the interaction between race/ethnicity and poverty, and drivers for identified disparities. Large cSLE registries will facilitate investigating disparities in groups of patients that have yet to be identified. Social-ecological models can inform approaches to investigate, monitor, and address disparities in cSLE."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in follow-up adherence for incidental pulmonary nodules (IPNs) using a cascade-of-care framework, representing the multistage pathway from IPN diagnosis to timely follow-up adherence.','A cohort of 1,562 patients diagnosed with IPNs requiring follow-up in a tertiary health care system in 2016 were retrospectively identified. Racial/ethnic disparities in follow-up adherence were examined by developing a multistep cascade-of-care model (provider communication, follow-up examination ordering and scheduling, adherence) to identify where patients were most likely to fall off the path toward adherence. Racial/ethnic adherence disparities were measured using descriptive statistics and multivariate modeling, controlling for sociodemographic, communication, and health characteristics.','Among 1,562 patients whose IPNs required follow-up, unadjusted results showed that nonwhite patients were less likely to meet each step on the cascade than White patients: for provider-patient IPN communication, 55% among Black patients and 80% among White patients; for follow-up ordering and scheduling, 42% and 41% among Black patients and 66% and 64% among White patients; and for timely adherence, 29% among Black patients and 54% among White patients. Adjusting for provider communication, sociodemographic, and health characteristics, Black patients had increased odds of never adhering to and delaying follow-up compared with White patients (odds ratios, 1.30 [95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.89] and 2.51 [95% confidence interval, 1.54-4.09], respectively).','These findings demonstrate substantial racial/ethnic disparities in IPN follow-up adherence that persist after adjusting for multiple characteristics. The cascade of care demonstrates where on the adherence pathway patients are at risk for falling off, enabling specific targets for health policy and clinical interventions. Radiologists can play a key role in improving IPN follow-up via increased patient care involvement."
"Sexual minorities (SMs) experience elevated rates of substance use behaviors and disorders relative to heterosexuals; minority stress is theorized to contribute to these disparities. As SMs are not a homogenous group, analyses that aggregate SMs across sexual identity, age, or gender obscure important variation among this population. To date, age- and gender-specific disparities have not been rigorously examined using a large national sample.','Using data on 67,354 adults (ages 18-49) from the 2015 and 2016 National Survey of Drug Use and Health we examined age- and gender-specific disparities in smoking, heavy episodic drinking, marijuana use, illicit drug use, and alcohol/substance use disorder. Age groups were ages 18-25, 26-34, and 35-49. Using logistic regression, we estimated age- and gender-specific odds ratios for gay/lesbian and bisexual individuals, relative to heterosexuals; analyses adjusted for demographic characteristics.','Bisexual women had significantly elevated odds of all outcomes at all ages, relative to heterosexual women. Gay/lesbian individuals had significantly elevated odds for nearly all outcomes compared to same-gender heterosexuals at ages 18-25, but not consistently at older ages. For bisexual men, significant disparities compared to heterosexual men were only observed at ages 35-49 for marijuana use and alcohol/substance use disorder.','We found notable within-group differences regarding SM disparities. While disparities were most pronounced in young adulthood for gay/lesbian individuals and mid-adulthood for bisexual men, bisexual women uniquely experienced disparities across all ages. Minority stress experiences may vary with respect to gender, age/cohort, and sexual identity, resulting in differential risk for substance use."
"Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in trauma care and outcomes among young adults are well documented. As the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion has increased insurance coverage among young adults, we aimed to investigate its impact on disparities in insurance coverage and outcomes among hospitalized young adult trauma patients.','We used the healthcare cost and utilization project state inpatient databases to examine changes in insurance coverage and risk-adjusted outcomes from before (2012-2013) to after (2014) Medicaid expansion among young adults (age 19-44) hospitalized for injury across 11 Medicaid expansion states. Changes were compared across racial/ethnic and community-level income groups. We also compared changes in disparities between three expansion and three nonexpansion states in the US south.','In the first year of Medicaid expansion, non-Hispanic black trauma patients experienced a large decrease in uninsurance (34.3%-14.2%, P < 0.01), reducing the disparity in uninsurance between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white patients (P < 0.05). There were no differences across racial/ethnic groups in changes in in-hospital mortality, failure to rescue, discharge to rehabilitation, or 30-d unplanned readmissions. Socioeconomic disparities in discharge to rehabilitation decreased (1.63% versus 0.06% increase among patients from the lowest and highest income communities, P < 0.05). In contrast, in the selected southern states, Medicaid expansion was associated with the introduction of a disparity in discharge to inpatient rehabilitation between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.','Medicaid expansion, in its first year, decreased racial and socioeconomic disparities in uninsurance and socioeconomic disparities in access to rehabilitation."
"Incisional hernias (IH) are iatrogenically created in 400 000 new patients annually. Without repair, IH-associated complications can result in major illness and death. The health disparities literature suggests that under-represented patients present more frequently with surgical emergencies. The health disparities associated with IH remain relatively unstudied.','Inpatient admission data were obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample for 2012-2014. Patients with IH International Classification of Diseases ninth revision were included. Analyses were completed using survey specific procedures (SAS v.9.4). Type of admission within groups was compared via Rao-Scott chi-square tests. The probability of an elective admission was modeled via SurveyLogistic Procedure.','Of 39 296 cases, 38.5% IH admissions were urgent or emergent (nonelective). The proportion of nonelective admission was statistically higher (<i>P</i> < .0001) in patients >65 (40.9%) and females (40.3%). Among insurance types, self-paying patients had the highest proportion of nonelective admissions (64.3%). Racial disparities remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and insurance. Compared with white patients, the odds of an admission being nonelective were significantly higher for black (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI]: 1.65 [1.53-1.77]], Hispanic (OR [95% CI]: 1.39 [1.28-1.51]), and other (OR [95% CI]: 1.2 [1.06-1.37]) patients.','These data show that multiple at-risk patient populations are significantly more likely to require urgent admission for IH-related complications. These include older, female, non-white, and uninsured patients. Systematic efforts to ameliorate these disparities should be developed."
"How can we limit wealth disparities while stimulating economic flows in sustainable societies? To examine the link between these concepts, we propose an econophysics asset exchange model with the surplus stock of the wealthy. The wealthy are one of the two exchange agents and have more assets than the poor. Our simulation model converts the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy to a new variable parameter alongside the saving rate and introduces the total exchange (flow) and rank correlation coefficient (metabolism) as new evaluation indexes, adding to the Gini index (disparities), thereby assessing both wealth distribution and the relationships among the disparities, flow, and metabolism. We show that these result in a gamma-like wealth distribution, and our model reveals a trade-off between limiting disparities and vitalizing the market. To limit disparities and increase flow and metabolism, we also find the need to restrain savings and use the wealthy surplus stock. This relationship is explicitly expressed in the new equation introduced herein. The insights gained by uncovering the root of disparities may present a persuasive case for investments in social security measures or social businesses involving stock redistribution or sharing."
"Health disparities encompass a wide range of personal, societal, environmental, and system-based factors that contribute to inequitable health and health outcomes in vulnerable patient populations. The goal of this work was to scientifically summarize the existing published North American research on disparity as it pertains to pediatric dermatology.','A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A medical librarian performed electronic searches from multiple electronic databases from their dates of inception to March 2021. Title and abstracts were reviewed by authors, identifying articles for full review. Data on article characteristics and identified disparities were then extracted and collected in a spreadsheet.','Fifty-one articles met final inclusion criteria, of which 25 highlighted disparities due to race/ethnicity, 13 highlighted disparities due to socioeconomic (SES), and 13 highlighted disparities due to both race/ethnicity and SES. The most frequent study designs were cross-sectional or survey, followed by retrospective cohort. Only two were prospective cohort studies. Disparities reported included reduced access to care and medications, increased school absenteeism, reduced knowledge about skin care including sun protection, increased hospitalizations and emergency department visits, and severe and persistent disease in the setting of minority race and poverty, among other indicators.','There are few, scattered research studies addressing disparity in pediatric dermatology. Greater focus will be needed in the future to improve knowledge of sources of disparity and its detrimental effects on the health of children, to rectify the notable disparity under-reporting of disparity research."
"We examined whether draft 2020 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung cancer screening recommendations ""partially ameliorate racial disparities in screening eligibility"" compared with the 2013 guidelines, as claimed. Using data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, USPSTF-2020 increased eligibility by similar proportions for minorities (97.1%) and Whites (78.3%). Contrary to the intent of USPSTF-2020, the relative disparity (differences in percentages of model-estimated gainable life-years from National Lung Screening Trial-like screening by eligible Whites vs minorities) actually increased from USPSTF-2013 to USPSTF-2020 (African Americans: 48.3%-33.4% = 15.0% to 64.5%-48.5% = 16.0%; Asian Americans: 48.3%-35.6% = 12.7% to 64.5%-45.2% = 19.3%; Hispanic Americans: 48.3%-24.8% = 23.5% to 64.5%-37.0% = 27.5%). However, augmenting USPSTF-2020 with high-benefit individuals selected by the Life-Years From Screening with Computed Tomography (LYFS-CT) model nearly eliminated disparities for African Americans (76.8%-75.5% = 1.2%) and improved screening efficiency for Asian and Hispanic Americans, although disparities were reduced only slightly (Hispanic Americans) or unchanged (Asian Americans). The draft USPSTF-2020 guidelines increased the number of eligible minorities vs USPSTF-2013 but may inadvertently increase racial and ethnic disparities. LYFS-CT could reduce disparities in screening eligibility by identifying ineligible people with high predicted benefit regardless of race and ethnicity."
"Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States, with approximately 805 000 cumulative deaths from myocardial infarctions (MI) from 2005 to 2014. Gender and racial/ethnic disparities in MI diagnoses are becoming more evident in quality review audits. Although recent changes in diagnostic codes provided an improved framework, clinically distinguishing types of MI remains a challenge. MI misdiagnoses and health disparities contribute to adverse outcomes in cardiac medicine. We conducted a literature review of relevant biomedical sources related to the classification of MI and disparities in cardiovascular care and outcomes. From the studies analyzed, African Americans and women have higher rates of mortality from MI, are more probably to be younger and present with other comorbidities and are less probably to receive novel therapies with respect to type of MI. As high-sensitivity troponin assays are adopted in the United States, implementation should account for how race and sex differences have been demonstrated in the reference range and diagnostic threshold of the newer assays. More research is needed to assess how the complexity of health disparities contributes to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Creating dedicated medical quality teams (physicians, nurses, clinical documentation improvement specialists, and medical coders) and incorporating a plan-do-check-adjust quality improvement model are strategies that could potentially help better define and diagnose MI, reduce financial burdens due to MI misdiagnoses, reduce cardiovascular-related health disparities, and ultimately improve and save lives."
"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Sexual minority adults experience considerable mental and physical health disparities compared to their heterosexual counterparts, but changes in these disparities over time may, in part, reflect changes in how the same people self-identify their sexual orientation. Therefore, we estimated between-cohort and within-person changes in self-identified sexual orientation to better understand changes in sexual orientation-based health disparities over the life course. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We examined 2009 to 2015 changes among 5712 adults 19-25 years of age from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) to validate a synthetic cohort approach applied to cross-sectional data on 1,168,346 adults 18-74 years of age (<i>n</i> = 29,677 sexual minority adults) from the General Practice Patient Survey (GPPS), estimating 2009 to 2017 changes in sexual orientation identification. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Heterosexual identification for adults 18-24 years of age fell three percentage points from 2009 to 2017. Approximately half of those 26-32 years of age, who identified as sexual minority adults in 2017, may not have identified as such 8 years earlier. LSYPE and GPPS results were similar, validating the synthetic cohort application. Within-cohort analyses estimated that 2.1% and 2.7% of heterosexual-identified women and men 18-24 years of age in 2009, respectively, changed identification by 2017. Smaller changes occurred for adults 25-34 years of age (1.0% and 1.2%, respectively), with still smaller differences at older ages. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Changes in health disparities may reflect people newly identifying as a sexual minority as well as longitudinal changes in those long identifying as sexual minority adults. Future research should measure the health of both early- and late-identifying sexual minority adults, as their health care and policy needs may differ."
"Ethnic inequalities in health outcomes are often explained by socioeconomic status and concentrated poverty. However, ethnic disparities in psychotic experiences are not completely attenuated by these factors.','We investigated whether disparities are better explained by interactions between individual risk factors and place-based clustering of disadvantage, termed a syndemic.','We performed a cross-sectional survey of 3750 UK men, aged 18-34 years, oversampling Black and minority ethnic (BME) men nationally, together with men residing in London Borough of Hackney. Participants completed questionnaires covering psychiatric symptoms, substance misuse, crime and violence, and risky sexual health behaviours. We included five psychotic experiences and a categorical measure of psychosis based on the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire.','At national level, more Black men reported psychotic experiences but disparities disappeared following statistical adjustment for social position. However, large disparities for psychotic experiences in Hackney were not attenuated by adjustment for social factors in Black men (adjusted odds ratio, 3.24; 95% CI 2.14-4.91; P < 0.002), but were for South Asian men. A syndemic model of joint effects, adducing a four-component latent variable (psychotic experiences and anxiety, substance dependence, high-risk sexual behaviour and violence and criminality) showed synergy between components and explained persistent disparities in psychotic experiences. A further interaction confirmed area-level effects (Black ethnicity × Hackney residence, 0.834; P < 0.001).','Syndemic effects result in higher rates of non-affective psychosis among BME persons in certain inner-urban settings. Further research should investigate how syndemics raise levels of psychotic experiences and related health conditions in Black men in specific places with multiple deprivations."
"Significant racial and ethnic healthcare disparities exist in the management and outcomes of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This review will highlight the recent studies focusing on disparities in AMI care and how practice patterns have changed over time, and discuss solutions and future directions to overcome disparities in AMI care.','AMI continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA. Racial and ethnic disparities continue to be present in the care and outcomes associated with AMI. Non-white individuals continue to receive less guideline-concordant care and experience higher rates of adverse outcomes compared with white individuals. Health policy and quality improvement interventions have helped to narrow the gap; however, ongoing efforts are needed to continue to attempt to eliminate this disparity. Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the presentation, management, and outcomes of patients with AMI. Improvements in care have narrowed some of the inequalities. Ongoing research and efforts directed at improving access to care, eliminating bias in healthcare, and focusing on coronary heart disease prevention are needed to eliminate disparities."
"Long-standing racial disparities exist in reproductive healthcare and have been associated with negative health outcomes among minority women. This study aimed to analyze the racial disparities in reproductive healthcare among Mississippi women, particularly as it related to contraception access, usage, setting, provider type, and payer.','A two-stage stratified probability design was employed - 95 of the 1500 licensed childcare facilities across the state were randomly selected, and then two to three classrooms were randomly selected within each facility. The children were the means to obtaining a weighted sample of parous women of childbearing age (15-44). Once a parous woman completed the study, she could invite a nulliparous friend of similar age, race, and socioeconomic background to also participate in the study.','Racial disparities were found in the reproductive healthcare of both the parous and nulliparous groups. Overall, black women were less likely to receive services from an obstetrics and gynecology. Parous and nulliparous black women were more likely to receive their reproductive healthcare at the health department and less likely to use the most effective methods of contraception.','Low use of the most effective methods of contraception, despite high levels of general contraceptive use and high insurance coverage, hints at additional barriers to full access for black women in Mississippi. More equitable access to effective family planning counseling and contraception can have meaningful impact on the lives of black women in our state."
"Comprehensively measure the trends in health disparities by sociodemographic strata in terms of exposure to lifestyle and metabolic risks, and prevalence and mortality of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) during the last 20 years in Belgium.','Cross-sectional analysis of periodic national-representative health interview surveys and vital statistics.','Population-based study of adult residents in Belgium between 1997 and 2018.','Adults aged 25-84 years and resident in Belgium in the years 1997 (7256 adults), 2001 (8665), 2004 (9054), 2008 (7343), 2013 (7704) and 2018 (8358).','Age-standardised prevalence rates of modifiable lifestyle risks (poor diet, smoking, excessive alcohol use and leisure-time physical inactivity), metabolic risks (high body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and cholesterol levels) and major NCDs (type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), with their relative health disparities across strata by age, sex, region of residence, nationality, education and income level, and according to high versus low engagement in the four lifestyle risks, calculated from a survey-weighted age-adjusted logistic regression.','Greater avoidable disparities were observed between extremes of education and income strata. The most marked disparities were found for exposure to lifestyle risks (except excessive alcohol use), prevalence of high BMI as well as T2DM, asthma and COPD, with disparities of daily smoking and COPD worsening over time. Still, NCD-specific mortality rates were significantly higher among men (except asthma), residents of Wallonia and Brussels (except cerebrovascular disease), and among the native Belgians (except T2DM and asthma). High engagement in lifestyle risks was generally observed for men, residents of the region Wallonia, and among lower education and income strata. This subgroup (20%) had a worse health profile as compared with those who had a low-risk lifestyle (25%), shown by prevalence ratios varying between 1.1 and 1.6 for metabolic risks, and between 1.8 and 3.7 for CVD, asthma and COPD.','Improving population health, including promoting greater health equity, requires approaches to be tailored to high-risk groups with actions tackling driving root causes of disparities seen by social factors and unhealthy lifestyle."
"Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to suffer from insomnia that is more severe; however, few studies have examined mechanisms by which racial disparities in severity of insomnia disorder may arise. One potential mechanism for disparities in insomnia severity is perceived discrimination. This study tested discrimination as a mediator in the relationship between race and insomnia.','Participants were recruited from communities in the Detroit metropolitan area and were diagnosed with insomnia disorder using the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). The final sample included 1,458 individuals. Insomnia symptom severity was assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index and self-reported racial discrimination was evaluated using a single item. Racial discrimination was tested as a mediator in the relationship between race and insomnia symptom severity. Individuals were categroized as either White or a racial minority (i.e., non White individuals), with sensitivity analyses examining Black individuals and non-Black racial minority groups.','Consistent with our hypothesis, racial discrimination was a significant mediator accounting for 57.3% of the relationship between race and insomnia symptom severity. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the indirect effect of racial discrimination was stronger in the non-Black racial minority group compared to Black individuals.','These results provide support that racial discrimination is likely an important mechanism by which racial and ethnic sleep disparities exist. Implications for prevention, intervention, and treatment of insomnia in racial minorities to reduce health disparities are discussed."
"This paper investigates Black-White differences in stress-including diverse measures of chronic, acute, discrimination-related, and cumulative stress exposure-and examines whether race differences in these stress measures mediate Black-White disparities in C-reactive protein (CRP) and metabolic dysregulation in later life.','Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (2004-2012), this study uses stepwise ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to examine the prospective associations between multiple stressors-including traumatic and stressful life events, financial strain, chronic stress, everyday and major life discrimination, and measures of cumulative stress burden-and CRP and metabolic dysregulation. Mediation analyses assessed the contribution of stress exposure to Black-White disparities in the outcomes.','Blacks experienced more stress than Whites across domains of stress, and stress exposure was strongly associated with CRP and metabolic dysregulation. Race differences in financial strain, everyday and major life discrimination, and cumulative stress burden mediated Black-White gaps in the outcomes, with measures of cumulative stress burden mediating the greatest proportion of the racial disparities.','The ""thousand cuts"" that Blacks experience from their cumulative stress exposure across domains of social life throughout the life course accelerate their physiological deterioration relative to Whites and play a critical role in racial health disparities at older ages."
"The Wayne State University Graduate Medical Education (GME) Office and Ascension Crittenton Hospital developed an educational initiative to increase resident awareness of health disparities and local community health priorities. The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) rapid-cycle performance improvement framework was used for implementation and evaluation.','During the first PDSA cycle, residents attended 5 didactic sessions. During the second PDSA cycle, residents participated in a problem-based learning (PBL) case. The following data were collected: evaluations of the didactic sessions and case, the number of appointments for diabetes self-management and education (DSME) referred by faculty and residents, and responses to questions on the annual GME surveys related to resident understanding of health disparities and the hospital's community health needs assessment (CHNA).','Eighty-eight percent of residents defined <i>health disparities</i> at least partially correctly in both project years. The percentage of residents who knew how to access their hospital's CHNA increased from 25% to 29% year over year. Residents rated PBL more effective in achieving learning objectives than didactics, but the difference was not statistically significant. Six appointments for DSME were referred by program faculty and residents in the 2-month period immediately before the didactic sessions, and 6 referrals were made in a 2-month period between the didactic sessions and the PBL case. In the 2-month period immediately following the PBL case, 9 appointments for DSME were referred by residents and program faculty.','Residents have a good understanding of health disparities, although many may not recognize disparities that exist in their local community. PBL was more effective than didactics for resident education about local health disparities, CHNA, and DSME. Aligning GME and hospital leadership in a common vision for disparities education, as well as community engagement, is critical to successful outcomes."
"Multiple studies have reported healthcare disparities in particular settings and conditions within pediatric otolaryngology, but a systematic examination of the breadth of the problem within the field is lacking. This study's objectives are to synthesize the available evidence regarding healthcare disparities in pediatric otolaryngology, highlight recurrent themes with respect to etiologies and manifestations, and demonstrate potential impacts from patient and provider standpoints.','A qualitative systematic review of the PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases for articles focusing on racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic disparities related to pediatric otolaryngology conditions or settings was conducted. United States-based studies of any design or publication date with analysis of children 0 to 18 years old were included.','Of 711 abstracts identified, 39 met inclusion criteria. Manual review of references from these articles yielded 22 additional studies, for a total of 61. Disparities were identified in nearly every subspecialty within pediatric otolaryngology, with otologic conditions the most frequently studied (33 of 61). The most commonly cited disparities involved low socioeconomic status (25 of 61), inadequate insurance (23 of 61), nonwhite race (21 of 61), and barriers to accessing care (21 of 61). Only six articles found no disparities regarding the condition examined in their study.','Through a variety of study topics, designs, and settings, a growing body of literature documents disparities across the spectrum of pediatric otolaryngology care. The etiologies and manifestations of such disparities are myriad. This evidence suggests the need for interventions to address these disparities at various professional and institutional levels, ideally with methodological rigor to assess the effectiveness of such interventions.

"Black patients referred for kidney transplantation have surpassed many obstacles but likely face continued racial disparities before transplant. The mechanisms that underlie these disparities are unclear. We determined the contributions of socioeconomic status (SES) and comorbidities as mediators to disparities in listing and transplant.','We studied a cohort (<i>n</i>=1452 black; <i>n</i>=1561 white) of patients with kidney failure who were referred for and started the transplant process (2009-2018). We estimated the direct and indirect effects of SES (self-reported income, education, and employment) and medical comorbidities (self-reported and chart-abstracted) as mediators of racial disparities in listing using Cox proportional hazards analysis with inverse odds ratio weighting. Among the 983 black and 1085 white candidates actively listed, we estimated the direct and indirect effects of SES and comorbidities as mediators of racial disparities on receipt of transplant using Poisson regression with inverse odds ratio weighting.','Within the first year, 876 (60%) black and 1028 (66%) white patients were waitlisted. The relative risk of listing for black compared with white patients was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.69 to 0.83); after adjustment for SES and comorbidity, the relative risk was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97). The proportion of the racial disparity in listing was explained by SES by 36% (95% CI, 26% to 57%), comorbidity by 44% (95% CI, 35% to 61%), and SES with comorbidity by 58% (95% CI, 44% to 85%). There were 409 (42%) black and 496 (45%) white listed candidates transplanted, with a median duration of follow-up of 3.9 (interquartile range, 1.2-7.1) and 2.8 (interquartile range, 0.8-6.3) years, respectively. The incidence rate ratio for black versus white candidates was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96); SES and comorbidity did not explain the racial disparity.','SES and comorbidity partially mediated racial disparities in listing but not for transplant."
"Drawing from cumulative inequality (CI) theory, the current study examined racial disparities in impairment as individuals approached death to determine whether proposed mechanisms hypothesized to fuel or diminish racial disparities at late ages were at work at the end of individualized life spans.','Black-white disparities were analyzed among decedents using latent growth curves based on the data from the North Carolina Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) (N = 1,926).','Consistent with previous literature, racial inequalities in functional disparities diminish at late ages. However, significant black-white disparities emerge as older adults approach death, exponentially increasing within the 2 years immediately preceding death. Further, these disparities are not fully mediated by socioeconomic status.','The results confirm that CI in health outcomes is observable in late life among individual life spans, suggesting the years surrounding death may be a particularly vulnerable period for health inequality. Future research should examine how advantaged statuses translate to increased access to health-related resources that aid in maintaining greater functional independence until the last stage of life."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare, including orthopedics, have been extensively documented. However, the level of knowledge among orthopedic surgeons regarding racial/ethnic disparities is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the views of orthopedic surgeons on (1) the extent of racial/ethnic disparities in orthopedic care, (2) patient and system factors that may contribute, and (3) the potential role of orthopedic surgeons in the reduction of disparities.','Three hundred five members of the American Orthopaedic Association completed a survey to assess their knowledge of racial/ethnic disparities and their perceptions about the underlying causes.','Twelve percent of respondents believe that patients often receive different care based on race/ethnicity in healthcare in general, while 9 % believe that differences exist in orthopedic care in general, 3 % believe that differences exist within their hospitals/clinics, and 1 % reported differences in their own practices. Despite this, 68 % acknowledge that there is evidence of disparities in orthopedic care. Fifty-one percent believe that a lack of insurance significantly contributes to disparities. Thirty-five percent believe that diversification of the orthopedic workforce would be a ""very effective"" strategy in addressing disparities, while 25 % percent believe that research would be ""very effective"" and 24 % believe that surgeon education would be ""very effective.""','Awareness regarding racial/ethnic disparities in musculoskeletal care is low among orthopedic surgeons. Additionally, respondents were more likely to acknowledge disparities within the practices of others than their own. Increased diversity, research, and education may help improve knowledge of this problem."
"Understanding socioeconomic disparities in physical activity is important, given its contribution to overall population-wide health and to health disparities. Existing studies examining trends in these disparities have focused exclusively on physical activity during leisure-time and have not investigated the potential moderators of socioeconomic disparities in physical activity. Using self-reported data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007 to 2016 for 29,039 adults aged 20 years and over we examined education-related disparities in overall (total) moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, and in its sub-components, recreational (leisure-time) and non-recreational (active transportation and work) activity. We also examined if education-related disparities in physical activity were moderated by age, gender, and race/ethnicity.','Logistic regression models were used to evaluate disparities in physical activity according to education group and their moderation across age, gender, race/ethnicity, and time-period.','Overall activity levels (% ≥150 min/week) were highest amongst highly educated adults, yet contrasting education-related disparities were found for recreational and non-recreational activities (active transportation and work), favoring the highest- and lowest-educated groups respectively. Within each domain of activity, associations were moderated by age and race/ethnicity, and by gender for work-based activity. The net result was that education-related disparities in total activity were substantially larger in older adults (P < 0.001) and amongst women (P < 0.001). For example, the estimated difference in the probability of being active in the highest versus the lowest educational groups was 23.1% (95% CI: 19.1, 27.2) amongst those aged ≥60 years, yet 10.8% (95% CI: 7.1, 14.6) amongst those aged 20-39.','Education-related disparities in physical activity persisted from 2007 to 2016. Our results suggest that understanding and addressing these disparities requires assessment of their multiple domains, and identification of the demographic sub-groups for which the disparities are more or less pronounced."
"Objectives To describe trends in disparities research within pediatric otolaryngology as evidenced by major meeting presentations and to compare observed trends with those in the realm of patient safety and quality improvement (PSQI). Study Design Retrospective review of presentations at national otolaryngology meetings. Setting Online review of meeting programs. Subjects and Methods Meeting programs from the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Triological Society, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, and Society for Ear, Nose and Throat Advances in Children from 2003 to 2016 were manually searched for pediatric oral and poster presentations addressing disparities and socioeconomic determinants of health, as well as PSQI. Presentation frequency was compared between categories and within each category over time. Results Of 11,311 total presentations, 3078 were related to the pediatric population, and 1945 (63.2%) of those were oral presentations. Disparities-related presentations increased from 0 in 2003 to 17 in 2016. From 2003 to 2009, 9 of 656 (1.4%) presentations involved disparities, as opposed to 70 of 2422 (2.9%) from 2010 to 2016 ( P = .03). The proportion of presentations regarding PSQI also increased: from 42 of 656 (6.4%) in 2003-2009 to 221 of 2422 (9.1%) in 2010-2016 ( P = .01). PSQI presentations remain more common than disparities presentations (9.1% vs 2.9%, P < .001). Conclusion Health care disparities are increasingly addressed in pediatric otolaryngology meeting presentations. Compared with the well-established realm of PSQI, disparities research remains nascent but is gaining attention. Health care reform and quality improvement efforts should recognize the role of socioeconomic factors and include strategies for addressing disparities."
"To characterize racial and ethnic disparities in the evaluation and reporting of suspected abusive head trauma (AHT) across the 18 participating sites of the Pediatric Brain Injury Research Network (PediBIRN). We hypothesized that such disparities would be confirmed at multiple sites and occur more frequently in patients with a lower risk for AHT.','Aggregate and site-specific analysis of the cross-sectional PediBIRN dataset, comparing AHT evaluation and reporting frequencies in subpopulations of white/non-Hispanic and minority race/ethnicity patients with lower vs higher risk for AHT.','In the PediBIRN study sample of 500 young, acutely head-injured patients hospitalized for intensive care, minority race/ethnicity patients (n = 229) were more frequently evaluated (P < .001; aOR, 2.2) and reported (P = .001; aOR, 1.9) for suspected AHT than white/non-Hispanic patients (n = 271). These disparities occurred almost exclusively in lower risk patients, including those ultimately categorized as non-AHT (P = .001 [aOR, 2.4] and P = .003 [aOR, 2.1]) or with an estimated AHT probability of ≤25% (P <.001 [aOR, 4.1] and P <.001 [aOR, 2.8]). Similar site-specific analyses revealed that these results reflected more extreme disparities at only 2 of 18 sites, and were not explained by local confounders.','Significant race/ethnicity-based disparities in AHT evaluation and reporting were observed at only 2 of 18 sites and occurred almost exclusively in lower risk patients. In the absence of local confounders, these disparities likely represent the impact of local physicians' implicit bias."
"Health disparities exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic have prompted healthcare professionals to investigate disparities within their own specialty. Racial and ethnic disparities in obstetrics are well documented but inequities in gynaecology are less well known. Our aim is to review the literature on two commonly performed procedures, hysterectomy and myomectomy, and one condition, ectopic pregnancy, to evaluate the prevalence of racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in benign gynaecology and minimal access surgery.','A narrative review of 33 articles identified from a Pubmed using the following search criteria; ""race""; ""ethnicity""; ""socioeconomic status""; ""disparity""; ""inequity""; and ""inequality"". Case reports and papers assessing gynaecological malignancy were excluded.','Despite minimal access surgery having fewer complications and faster recovery than open surgery, US studies have shown that black and ethnic minority women are less likely than white women to have minimally invasive hysterectomies and myomectomies. Uninsured women and patients on Medicaid are also less likely to receive minimally invasive procedures. Contributing factors include fibroid size, geographic location and access to hospitals performing minimal access surgery, and the discontinuation of power morcellation. Ethnic minority women who receive minimally invasive myomectomy have been shown to have a higher risk of complications and prolonged recovery. Black and ethnic minority women also have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality from ectopic pregnancy and are more likely to receive surgical than medical management.','Extensive study from the US has demonstrated disparities in access to minimally invasive gynaecological surgery, whereas in the UK the data is infrequent, inconsistent and incomplete. Little is known about the influence of patient preference and counselling as well as institutional bias on health equity in gynaecology. Further research is necessary to identify interventions that mitigate these disparities in access and outcomes."
"Racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, age, and sex-related health disparities in kidney disease are prominent in the United States. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected marginalized populations. Older adults, people experiencing unstable housing, racial and ethnic minorities, and immigrants are potentially at increased risk for infection and severe complications from COVID-19. The direct and societal effects of the pandemic may increase risk of incident kidney disease and lead to worse outcomes for those with kidney disease. The rapid transition to telemedicine potentially limits access to care for older adults, immigrants, and people experiencing unstable housing. The economic impact of the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on women, minorities, and immigrants, which may limit their ability to manage kidney disease and lead to complications or kidney disease progression. We describe the impact of COVID-19 on marginalized populations and highlight how the pandemic may exacerbate existing disparities in kidney disease."
"There is no information on disparities of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and their caregivers. The objective of this exploratory study is to compare patients with PNES and caregivers with low socioeconomic status (SES) with those of high SES for disparities in healthcare use, seizures, medication adverse effects, psychosocial impact, and knowledge about epilepsy.','Patients with PNES and caregivers completed surveys about the aforementioned outcomes during their Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) admission. Associations were evaluated using SES as a binary independent variable and the patient- and caregiver-related outcomes as dependent variables.','Forty-three patients and 28 caregivers were recruited. The majority of patients were on average 36 years old, single women, unemployed, with some college education. The majority had PNES for 8 years averaging 20 seizures per month and were maintained on ≥2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) prior to their EMU admission. Most caregivers were first-degree relatives with a mean age of 43 years, married employed women of higher educational attainment, typically cohabitating with the patients. Low SES patients showed poorer knowledge about epilepsy (p < 0.0001) and higher anxiety levels (p = 0.03). Conversely, high SES patients demonstrated poorer social functioning (p = 0.04). High SES caregivers showed higher caregiving burden (p = 0.01).','There are noteworthy disparities in patients with PNES of different SES and their caregivers. Identification of those disparities is a critical step in the creation of appropriate interventions to address them."
"The United States experienced severe mental health budget cuts in many states across the nation during the years of the largest recession since the Great Depression. Illinois had one of the hardest hit mental health budgets in the country. The massive mental health funding cuts in Illinois, combined with the state's budget impasse, left fewer facilities available to provide treatment and support to those in need. Many of Illinois's most vulnerable populations either had reduced access, or no access to care. Serious spillover effects were felt by emergency rooms, community hospitals, and the criminal justice system. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine disparities in Health Related Quality of Life for those with depression after the funding cuts in Illinois.','Data from the 2017 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System was analyzed by using multivariate logistic regression models of the Health Related Quality of Life measures for Illinoisans diagnosed with depressive disorders.','According to the regression models in this study, disparities exist in HRQOL for Illinoisans with depressive disorders. In all of the HRQOL models, income was associated with a reduction in HRQOL. Additionally, disparities exist in HRQOL for certain age groups and those who are unemployed. Interestingly, the models did not show any racial disparities as anticipated.','Without the basic policy-level deficiencies addressed, disparities in Health Related Quality of Life for Illinois's most vulnerable populations will continue to exist as will costly economic spillover effects."
"Research has identified a broad range of risk factors during early childhood that have neurobiological consequences and negatively affect children's mental health. Such risk factors disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minority youth. Disparities in children's mental health service use have also been documented for minority youth. Yet, compared with the focus on strategies to address health disparities (including mental health disparities) during adulthood, very little work has concentrated on addressing the roots of health disparities that occur in childhood. The purpose of this commentary is to describe the development and dissemination of a policy brief for policy advocates. The goal of this work is to help achieve the implementation of evidence-based programs, practices, and policies that target and modify risk factors to reduce disparities in child mental health burden."
"A striking increase in the all-cause mortality of US middle-aged non-Hispanic Whites in the past two decades has been documented by previous studies. The inter-cohort patterns in US mortality, as well as their racial/ethnic disparities, are still unclear.','Using official mortality data, we study US annual mortality rates for ages 25-54 from 1990 to 2016 by gender and race/ethnicity. We conduct an age-period-cohort analysis to disentangle the period and cohort forces driving the absolute changes in mortality across cohorts. Nine leading causes of death are also explored to explain the inter-cohort mortality patterns and their racial/ethnic disparities.','We find cohort-specific elevated mortality trends for gender- and race/ethnicity-specific populations. For non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics, Baby Boomers have increased mortality trends compared with other cohorts. For non-Hispanic White females, it is late-Gen Xers and early-Gen Yers for whom the mortality trends are higher than other cohorts. For non-Hispanic White males, the elevated mortality pattern is found for Baby Boomers, late-Gen Xers, and early-Gen Yers. The mortality pattern among Baby Boomers is at least partially driven by mortality related to drug poisoning, suicide, external causes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HIV/AIDS for all race and gender groups affected. The elevated mortality patterns among late-Gen Xers and early-Gen Yers are at least partially driven by mortality related to drug poisonings and alcohol-related diseases for non-Hispanic Whites. Differential patterns of drug poisoning-related mortality play an important role in the racial/ethnic disparities in these mortality patterns.','We find substantial racial/ethnic disparities in inter-cohort mortality patterns. Our findings also point to the unique challenges faced by younger generations."
"Both health insurance status and race independently impact colon cancer (CC) care delivery and outcomes. The relative importance of these factors in explaining racial and insurance disparities is less clear, however. This study aimed to determine the association and interaction of race and insurance with CC treatment disparities.','Retrospective cohort review of a prospective hospital-based database.','In this cross-sectional study, patients diagnosed with stage I to III CC in the United States were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB; 2006 to 2016). Multivariable regression with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were performed to evaluate the association of insurance and race/ethnicity with odds of receipt of surgery (stage I to III) and adjuvant chemotherapy (stage III), with an additional 2-way interaction term to evaluate for effect modification. Confounders included sex, age, median income, rurality, comorbidity, and nodes and margin status for the model for chemotherapy. Of 353,998 patients included, 73.8% (n = 261,349) were non-Hispanic White (NHW) and 11.7% (n = 41,511) were non-Hispanic Black (NHB). NHB patients were less likely to undergo resection [odds ratio (OR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 0.72, p < 0.001] or to receive adjuvant chemotherapy [OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.87, p < 0.001] compared to NHW patients. NHB patients with private or Medicare insurance were less likely to undergo resection [OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91, p = 0.004 (private insurance); OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.66, p < 0.001 (Medicare)] and to receive adjuvant chemotherapy [0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.87, p < 0.001 (private insurance); OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.91, p < 0.001 (Medicare)] compared to similarly insured NHW patients. Although Hispanic patients with private and Medicare insurance were also less likely to undergo surgical resection, this was not the case with adjuvant chemotherapy. This study is mainly limited by the retrospective nature and by the variables provided in the dataset; granular details such as continuity or disruption of insurance coverage or specific chemotherapy agents or dosing cannot be assessed within NCDB.','This study suggests that racial disparities in receipt of treatment for CC persist even among patients with similar health insurance coverage and that different disparities exist for different racial/ethnic groups. Changes in health policy must therefore recognize that provision of insurance alone may not eliminate cancer treatment racial disparities."
"To measure disparities in experience of police use of force and injury among persons with serious mental illnesses.','We gathered novel police use of force and suspect injury data from 2011 to 2017 from a nonrandom sample of nine police departments in the United States and used synthetic methods to estimate the share of the local population with serious mental illness. We estimate disparities using multi-level models estimated in a Bayesian framework.','Persons with serious mental illness constitute 17.0% of use of force cases (SD = 5.8) and 20.2% of suspects injured in police interaction (SD = 9.0) in sample cities. The risk that persons with serious mental illness will experience police use of force is 11.6 times higher (95% CI, 10.7-12.6) than persons without serious mental illness. Persons with serious mental illness are also at a higher risk of experiencing injury, 10.7 times (95% CI, 9.6-11.8), relative to persons without serious mental illness. These relative risk ratios are several times larger than racial and ethnic disparities estimated in the same cities.','Persons with serious mental are at a significantly elevated risk of experiencing police use of force and injury in police encounters than the general public. The disparities we estimate are several times higher than racial/ethnic disparities in force and injury. Efforts to reform police practices and reimagine public safety in the United States should address significant disparities in police use of force against those with serious mental illness."
"Prior studies demonstrated that wage disparities exist across race and ethnicity within selected health care occupations. Wage disparities may negatively affect the industry's ability to recruit and retain a diverse workforce throughout the career ladder.','To determine whether wage disparities by race and ethnicity persist across health care occupations and whether disparities vary across the skill spectrum.','Retrospective analysis of 2011-2018 data from the Current Population Survey using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition regression methods to identify sources of variation in wage disparities. Separate models were run for 9 health care occupations.','Employed individuals 18 and older working in health care occupations, categorized by race/ethnicity.','Annual wages were predicted as a function of race/ethnicity, age, sex, marital status, having a child under 5 in the household, living in a metro area, highest education attained, and usual hours worked.','Non-Hispanics consistently made more than Hispanic licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/LVNs), aides/assistants, technicians, and community-based workers. Asian/Pacific Islanders consistently made more than Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Multiracial individuals across occupations except physicians, advanced practitioners, or therapists. Asian/Pacific Islanders only made significantly less when compared with White physicians, but more than White advanced practitioners, registered nurses, LPNs/LVNs, and aides/assistants. Based on observed attributes, Black registered nurses, LPNs/LVNs, and aides/assistants were predicted to make more than their White peers, but unexplained variation negated these gains.','Many wage gaps remained unexplained based on measured factors warranting further study. Addressing wage disparities is critical to advance in careers and reduce job turnover."
"Given recent national attention to the role of racism in perpetuating racial inequities in society and health, this review provides a timely and relevant summary of key measures of systemic racism in kidney transplantation. More specifically, the review identifies current and promising interventions, whereas highlighting the need for more sustainable and impactful interventions.','Racial disparities persist in kidney transplantation. Black and Hispanic individuals are less likely to receive a kidney transplant than non-Hispanic Whites despite disproportionately higher rates of kidney failure. Studies demonstrate that socioeconomic factors do not fully explain existing racial disparities in transplantation. Systemic racism at all levels, individual, interpersonal, institutional, and structural, is at the core of racial disparities, and current interventions are insufficient in mitigating their effects. Thus, targeted and sustainable interventions must be implemented to mitigate systemic racism in kidney transplantation.','Systemic racism in all its forms continues to influence disparities at all stages of kidney transplantation. This paper highlights recent findings that shed light on how racism contributes to racial disparities in kidney transplantation. Using these findings to identify targets and strategies for mitigation, relevant interventions and policies that show promise are detailed."
"Black-White disparities in child welfare involvement have been well-documented in the United States, but there is a significant knowledge gap in Ontario about how and when these disparities emerge.','This paper compares incidence data on Black and White families investigated by Ontario's child welfare system over a 20-year period.','Data from the first five cycles of the Ontario Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (OIS) (1993-2013) were used to examine trends in child maltreatment investigations involving Black and White families. Incidence rates were calculated. T-tests were conducted to assess statistically significant differences between and within cycles. Population and decision-based enumeration approaches were also used to examine child welfare disparities.','The incidence of investigations involving White families almost doubled between 1998 and 2003, but for Black families the incidence increased almost fourfold during the same period. These increases and the difference between Black and White families in 2003 were statistically significant. The results further indicate that Black families experience disparate representation in Ontario's child welfare system over time for most service dispositions.','Several possible explanations are offered for the study's outcome, including changes in risk related to social safety net, the threshold for risk of harm, and bias and racist institutional policies and practices. This study invites policy-makers and child welfare authorities to rethink service delivery in addressing the disparate representation of Black families in the child welfare system."
"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) patients face challenging health care disparities. However, due to restrictions in reporting and collection of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) demographic data, comprehensive studies of surgical disparities in the LGBTQ+ population are limited. This review aims to summarize the existing literature describing surgical disparities in LGBTQ+ patients and to identify areas of surgical care in which further studies are warranted. This review addresses the literature in infectious diseases, substance use disorders, bariatrics, cardiovascular medicine, oncology, and laryngology as relevant to surgical practice. Understanding the current landscape of knowledge in LGBTQ+ surgical disparities and the areas where gaps in research exist will help the surgeon to create a framework of practice to provide more equitable care to LGBTQ+ patients."
"Racial disparities are prevalent in many aspects of obstetric care in the USA. Non-Hispanic black women have a higher prevalence of the diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in addition to associated morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review is to review current data regarding racial disparities in the diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.','Diagnosis of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is more common among non-Hispanic black women even after adjustment for comorbidities. Furthermore, prevalence of severe morbidity among those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is increased in non-Hispanic black women, including cardiovascular events related. Proposed management solutions include quality improvement initiatives, telehealth, and strategies to reduce both structural racism and implicit bias. Racial disparities exist in both diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; further innovative work is needed to reduce these disparities."
"While SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, contagious respiratory illnesses are not a new problem. Limited research has examined the extent to which place- and race-based disparities in severe illness are similar across waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and historic influenza seasons. In this study, we focused on these disparities within a low-income population, those enrolled in Medicaid in New York City. We used 2015-2020 New York State Medicaid claims to compare the characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during three separate waves of 2020 (first wave: January 1-April 30, 2020; second wave: May 1-August 31, 2020; third wave: September 1-December 31, 2020) and with influenza during the 2016 (July 1, 2016-June 30, 2017) and 2017 influenza seasons (July 1, 2017-June 30, 2018). We found that patterns of hospitalization by race/ethnicity and ZIP code across the two influenza seasons and the first wave of COVID-19 were similar (increased risk among non-Hispanic Black (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10-1.25) compared with non-Hispanic white Medicaid recipients). Black/white disparities in hospitalization dissipated in the second COVID wave and reversed in the third wave. The commonality of disparities across influenza seasons and the first wave of COVID-19 suggests there are community factors that increase hospitalization risk across novel respiratory illness incidents that emerge in the period before aggressive public health intervention. By contrast, convergence in hospitalization patterns in later pandemic waves may reflect, in part, the distinctive public health response to COVID-19."
"While overall cancer mortality has steadily decreased in recent decades, cancer health disparities among racial and ethnic population groups persist. Here we studied the relationship between cancer survival disparities (CSD), genetic ancestry (GA), and tumor molecular signatures across 33 cancers in a cohort of 9,818 patients. GA correlated with race and ethnicity but showed observable differences in effects on CSD, with significant associations identified in four cancer types: breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and skin cutaneous carcinoma (SKCM). Differential gene expression and methylation between ancestry groups associated cancer-related genes with CSD, of which, seven protein-coding genes [progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 6 (PAQR6), Lck-interacting transmembrane adaptor 1 (LIME1), Sin3A-associated protein 25 (SAP25), MAX dimerization protein 3 (MXD3), coiled-coil glutamate rich protein 2 (CCER2), refilin A (RFLNA), and cathepsin W (CTSW)] significantly interacted with GA and exacerbated observed survival disparities. These findings indicated that regulatory changes mediated by epigenetic mechanisms have a greater contribution to CSD than population-specific mutations. Overall, we uncovered various molecular mechanisms through which GA might impact CSD, revealing potential population-specific therapeutic targets for groups disproportionately burdened by cancer.','This large-cohort, multicancer study identifies four cancer types with cancer survival disparities and seven cancer-related genes that interact with genetic ancestry and contribute to disparities."
"To determine whether racial/ethnic differences in patient experiences with care, potentially leading to underutilization of necessary care, are associated with disparities in Gleason score at diagnosis.','We used the SEER-CAHPS linked dataset to identify Medicare beneficiaries who completed a Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey prior to diagnosis of prostate cancer. Independent variables included aspects of patient experiences with care captured by CAHPS surveys. We conducted survey weighted multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses, stratified by patient race/ethnicity, to estimate associations of CAHPS measures with Gleason score at diagnosis.','Of the 4,245 patients with prostate cancer, most were non-Hispanic white (NHW) (77.6%), followed by non-Hispanic black (NHB) (8.4%), Hispanic (8.4%), and Asian (5.6%). Excellent experience with getting needed prescription drugs was associated with lower odds of Gleason scores of 7 and 8-10 in NHBs (7: OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.05-0.67; 8-10: OR = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.01-0.2) and lower odds of 8-10 in NHWs (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.40-0.93). For NHBs, excellent primary physician ratings were associated with greater odds of a Gleason score of 8-10 (OR = 13.28, 95% CI = 1.53-115.21).','Patient experiences with access to care and physician relationships may influence Gleason score in different ways for patients of different racial/ethnic groups. More research, including large observational studies with greater proportions of racial/ethnic minority patients, is necessary to understand these relationships and target interventions to overcome disparities and improve patient outcomes."
"Based in Allegheny County, a coalition of local stakeholders took note of the region's infant mortality rates, particularly the stark disparities observed by race, and established a vision to reduce infant mortality in the region. The group undertook a multi-faceted effort to (1) develop predictive models of infant mortality risk; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of available interventions; and (3) combine these tools in order to tailor intervention referrals based on maternal risk profiles. With this effort, the coalition sought to address the apparent disconnect between the region's robust maternal and child health care system and relatively poor birth and infant outcomes and racial disparities.','The effort started with the integration of data from a variety of sources into an integrated database built specifically for this research effort covering the period 2003 to 2013. With the database, researchers linked each individual's data across multiple data sources, including the Allegheny County Health Department, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the Allegheny County Department of Human Services Data Warehouse, and individual programs. With these data, we used a standard method for comparing outcomes and measuring the racial disparity between Black and white infants that involved calculating a ratio by dividing the rate or percentage for Black infants by the rate or percentage for white infants.','Overall, the results showed that between 2003 and 2013 in Allegheny County disparities were more pronounced for infant mortality (3.25) than low birthweight (1.88) or preterm birth (1.49). Among the different potential causes of infant mortality, the most pronounced disparity was for SIDS (1.78). Among maternal health factors, pre-pregnancy obesity and gestational diabetes had the highest infant mortality disparity. The low birthweight disparity was similar and lower than the infant mortality disparity across all of the maternal health factors, while the preterm birth disparity was even lower. For the maternal behavioral and contextual factors, the infant mortality disparity ranged from 1.5 to 2.3.','The 11-year span of data reported in the IMPreSIv database and the breadth of intervention data included allowed us to report granular information on birth outcomes within Allegheny County over this time period. The database also allowed us to summarize the various factors associated with the range of birth outcomes and describe the participation rates in the medical and community setting interventions. Against this backdrop of pronounced disparities in birth outcomes across a range of factors, we examined the effectiveness of interventions for women with different risk factors (e.g. substance use disorders) in order to develop a tool to facilitate individualized referrals to the interventions that will help the most for a specific risk profile."
"People experiencing homelessness (PEH) suffer higher burdens of chronic illnesses, have higher rates of emergency medicine (ED) use and hospitalization, and ultimately are at increased risk for premature death compared to housed counterparts. Structural racism contributes to a disproportionate burden of homelessness among people of color. PEH experience not only significant medical concerns but also complex social needs that need to be addressed concurrently for effective healing, issues that have been magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. As health disparities and structural racism intersect among PEH, it is critically important to develop PEH-centered interventions to improve care and health outcomes as part of an effort to dismantle racism. One opportunity to address these disparities in care for PEH is through training ED physicians on methods for identifying and intervening on the unique needs of vulnerable patient groups. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has outlined health quality pathways in the clinical learning environment to address health disparities. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is particularly well suited for this scenario as it allows experiential learning for trainees to work with and understand a diverse group of stakeholders, to deepen their knowledge of local health disparities, and to lead research and measure outcomes of interventions to tackle health disparities. In this paper, we highlight the utility of CBPR in fostering experiential learning for EM residents on tackling health disparities and the importance of community collaboration in trainee-led interventions for comprehensive ED care."
"Ethnic minorities in developed countries suffer a disproportionately high burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and COVID-19 ethnic disparities have been attributed to social determinants of health. Vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor that could mitigate COVID-19 health disparities. We investigated the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the UK Biobank, a large progressive cohort study of the United Kingdom population. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the ability of vitamin D, socioeconomic deprivation, and other known risk factors to mediate COVID-19 ethnic health disparities. Asian ethnicity is associated with higher COVID-19 susceptibility, compared to the majority White population, and Asian and Black ethnicity are both associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Socioeconomic deprivation mediates all three ethnic disparities and shows the highest overall signal of mediation for any COVID-19 risk factor. Vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, mediate the Asian disparity in COVID-19 susceptibility, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) levels mediate Asian and Black COVID-19 severity disparities. Several measures of overall health also mediate COVID-19 ethnic disparities, underscoring the importance of comorbidities. Our results support ethnic minorities' use of vitamin D as both a prophylactic and a supplemental therapeutic for COVID-19."
"Prostate cancer has the widest racial disparities of any cancer, and these disparities appear at every stage of the cancer continuum. This review focuses on the disparities in prostate cancer between Black and White men, spanning from prevention and screening to clinical outcomes. We conduct an expansive review of the literature on racial disparities in prostate cancer, interpret the findings, and discuss areas of unmet need in research. We provide an overview of epidemiologic concepts necessary to understanding the current state of prostate cancer disparities, discuss the complexities of studying race, and review potential drivers of disparities in incidence and mortality. We argue that the cause of this disparity is multifactorial and due to a combination of social and environmental factors. The path forward needs to focus on enrolling and retaining Black men in prostate cancer clinical trials and observational studies and identifying potential interventions to improve prevention and clinical outcomes in Black men."
"Sexual minoritized persons evidence higher prevalence of eating disorders than heterosexual persons, yet it is unclear which specific symptoms drive these disparities. Empirical evidence also documents the importance of considering subclinical eating disorder presentations, as well as potential differentiation in expression of eating disorder symptoms based on gender. The current study complements that of Kamody et al. (2020), who examined sexual orientation-based disparities in eating disorder diagnoses using a nationally representative sample of the US adult population.','Using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III), we compared the prevalence of eating disorder symptoms across sexual minority status separately for men and women.','Sexual minoritized men were more likely than heterosexual men to report body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (odds ratio [OR] = 1.76), thus, being screened into questions about restrictive eating. Sexual minoritized women were more likely than heterosexual women to endorse ever engaging in a binge-eating episode (OR = 2.25) and engaging in weekly binge eating for at least 3 months (OR = 1.58), thus, being screened into follow-up questions about binge eating. Sexual minoritized men were more likely than heterosexual men to fear gaining weight even when at their lowest weight (OR = 4.35) and experience a loss of control when overeating (OR = 3.13).','Sexual orientation-based disparities in eating disorder symptom endorsement were nuanced when stratifying the entire sample by gender. Findings expand previous research on disparities in clinical/diagnosed eating disorders, highlighting the importance of assessing symptomology beyond diagnosis, as well as the intersectional influence of sexual orientation and gender, in both research and practice."
"<b>Objectives:</b> Chronic stressors are associated with cardiometabolic health conditions and disparities. Mechanisms linking stressors and health remain poorly understood. <b>Methods:</b> Two cohort studies (Cardiac Rehabilitation And The Experience [CREATE] and Tracking Risk Identification for Adult Diabetes [TRIAD]) with harmonized variables were used to examine relationships between six types of chronic stressors in adulthood and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, as indicated by blunted diurnal cortisol slopes, which are stress-sensitive biomarkers implicated in cardiometabolic health (merged <i>N</i> = 213, mean age 61, 18% Black). A secondary aim was to explore whether these chronic stressors accounted for Black-White disparities in HPA axis regulation. <b>Results:</b> Some chronic stressors were linked to HPA axis dysregulation, with recent stressors most salient (<i>b</i> = 0.00353, SE = 0.00133, <i>p</i> = .008). Black-White disparities in HPA axis regulation persisted after controlling for racial differences in chronic stressors, which reduced the disparity 11.46%. <b>Discussion:</b> Chronic stressors in adulthood may increase risk for HPA axis dysregulation and associated cardiometabolic health outcomes but may not be a key factor in racial disparities."
"Disparities in COVID-19 mortality by race/ethnicity or neighborhood have been documented using surveillance data. We aimed to describe disparities by race/ethnicity and neighbourhood social vulnerability in COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, and mortality.','We obtained data from the electronic health records of all individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) or were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection in five UPHS hospitals from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. The main predictors were race/ethnicity and neighbourhood-level social vulnerability. The main outcomes were COVID-19 test positivity, hospitalization with COVID-19, and 30-day in-hospital mortality following hospitalization with COVID-19.','A total of 225,129 unique individuals received COVID-19 testing and 18,995 had a positive test result. A total of 5,794 unique patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 and 511 died in-hospital within 30 days. Racial/ethnic minority groups and residents of higher social vulnerability neighbourhoods had higher test positivity and risk of hospitalization. We did not see in-hospital mortality disparities during the first wave but observed 75% and 68% higher odds of death among Hispanic and Asians compared to Whites during subsequent waves.','We observed significant racial/ethnic and neighbourhood disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, especially test positivity and odds of hospitalization, highlighting the importance of equitably improving access to preventive measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reducing exposure to the virus and ensuring equity in vaccination.','National Institutes of Health."
"Coronavirus disease 2019 has created and amplified racial health disparities. This has been particularly noticeable in populations with asthma. There is no one simple reason for this occurrence, but rather a complex interaction of biological, structural, and socioeconomic factors. This article will highlight reasons why the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has been particularly impactful among minority populations throughout the world and will also offer potential solutions to help overcome health disparities."
"There are well-documented racial and ethnic disparities in treatment and perioperative outcomes for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.','We hypothesize that the implementation of a coordinated care pathway for pediatric patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may be associated with a reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in perioperative outcomes.','This is a retrospective pre- and post-test cohort study of patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis at our institution between July 1, 2013 and August 5, 2019. We implemented a coordinated care pathway in March 2015. Patient demographics included age, race, ethnicity, weight, gender, insurance status, ASA class, time between the date surgery was ordered and the date surgery occurred, degree of scoliosis, and the number of spinal levels fused. The primary outcome was length of stay. The secondary outcomes included transfusion rates, pain scores, and postoperative complications. Multivariable regression models compared outcome medians across race/ethnicity. Disparities were defined as the difference in adjusted outcomes by race/ethnicity.','Four hundred twenty-four patients underwent posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis at our institution (116 prepathway and 308 postpathway). The median length of stay of Black patients was 1.0 day (95% CI: 0.4, 1.5; p = .006) longer than White patients prepathway. Prepathway patients who self-identified as Other had a 1.2 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.9; p = .004) higher median average pain score on postoperative day 1 compared with White patients. On postoperative day 2, patients who identified as Other had 2.0 (95% CI: 0.8, 3.2; p = .005) higher pain score compared with White patients prepathway. Postpathway, there were no significant differences in outcomes by race/ethnicity.','Our study supports the hypothesis that use of a coordinated care pathway is associated with a reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in length of stay and pain scores in pediatric patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion."
"The study of racial/ethnic inequalities in health is important to reduce the uneven burden of disease. In the case of colorectal cancer (CRC), disparities in survival among non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks are well documented, and mechanisms leading to these disparities need to be studied formally. It has also been established that body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for developing CRC, and recent literature shows BMI at diagnosis of CRC is associated with survival. Since BMI varies by racial/ethnic group, a question that arises is whether differences in BMI are partially responsible for observed racial/ethnic disparities in survival for CRC patients. This article presents new methodology to quantify the impact of the hypothetical intervention that matches the BMI distribution in the Black population to a potentially complex distributional form observed in the White population on racial/ethnic disparities in survival. Our density mediation approach can be utilized to estimate natural direct and indirect effects in the general causal mediation setting under stronger assumptions. We perform a simulation study that shows our proposed Bayesian density regression approach performs as well as or better than current methodology allowing for a shift in the mean of the distribution only, and that standard practice of categorizing BMI leads to large biases when BMI is a mediator variable. When applied to motivating data from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium, our approach suggests the proposed intervention is potentially beneficial for elderly and low-income Black patients, yet harmful for young or high-income Black populations."
"The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), a public law in the United States passed in 2010, sought to improve the healthfulness of the school food environment by requiring updated nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. Studies conducted since the passage of the HHFKA indicate improvements in the food environment overall, but few studies have examined whether these improvements varied by the socioeconomic and racial/ethnic composition of students in schools. To better understand the extent of disparities in the school food environment after HHFKA, this paper examined differences in the healthfulness of school food environments and the nutritional quality of school lunches by the school poverty level and racial/ethnic composition of students using data from the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study. Results from chi-square analyses showed lower proportions of high poverty, majority black, and majority Hispanic schools had access to competitive foods, while higher proportions of these schools had a school wellness policy in addition to a district wellness policy. The overall nutritional quality of school lunches, as measured by total Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 scores, did not vary significantly across school types, although some HEI component scores did. From these findings, we concluded that there were disparities in the school food environment based on the socioeconomic and racial/ethnic composition of students in schools, but no significant disparities in the overall nutritional quality of school lunches were found."
"The US HIV epidemic is driven by infections in men who have sex with men and characterized by profound disparities in HIV prevalence and outcomes for Black Americans. Black men who have sex with men living with HIV are reported to have worse care outcomes than other men who have sex with men, but the reasons for these health inequities are not clear. We planned a prospective observational cohort study to help understand the reasons for worse HIV care outcomes for Black versus White men who have sex with men in Atlanta.','The aim of this study is to identify individual, dyadic, network, neighborhood, and structural factors that explain disparities in HIV viral suppression between Black and White men who have sex with men living with HIV in Atlanta.','Black and White men who have sex with men living with HIV were enrolled in a prospective cohort study with in-person visits and viral suppression assessments at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months; additional surveys of care and risk behaviors at 3, 6, and 18 months; analysis of care received outside the study through public health reporting; and qualitative interviews for participants who experienced sentinel health events (eg, loss of viral suppression) during the study. The study is based on the Bronfenbrenner socioecological theoretical model.','Men who have sex with men (n=400) were enrolled between June 2016 and June 2017 in Atlanta. Follow-up was completed in June 2019; final study retention was 80% at 24 months.','Health disparities for Black men who have sex with men are hypothesized to be driven by structural racism and barriers to care. Observational studies are important to document and quantify the specific factors within the socioecological framework that account for disparities in viral suppression. In the meantime, it is also critical to push for steps to improve access to care, including Medicaid expansion in Southern states, such as Georgia, which have not yet moved to expand Medicaid.','DERR1-10.2196/21985."
"Health information technology (health IT) potentially is a promising vital lever to address racial and ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality (MMM). This is especially relevant given that approximately 60% of maternal deaths are considered preventable.<sup>1-36</sup> Interventions that leverage health IT tools to target the underlying drivers of disparities at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels potentially could reduce disparities in quality of care throughout the continuum (antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum) of maternity care. This article presents an overview of the research (and gaps) on the potential of health IT tools to document SDoH and community-level geocoded data in EHR-based CDS systems, minimize implicit bias, and improve adherence to clinical guidelines and coordinated care to inform multilevel (patient, clinician, system) interventions throughout the continuum of maternity care for health disparity populations impacted by MMM. Telemedicine models for improving access in rural areas and new technologies for risk assessment and disease management (<i>e.g.</i>, regarding preeclampsia) also are discussed."
"This study aimed to identify small geographic areas where the childhood cancer yearly incidence and late-stage diagnosis rates were disproportionately higher among racial/ethnic minorities (Hispanics and non-Hispanic African Americans) in Texas.','The study examined childhood cancer disparities in Texas from 2005 to 2014, based on geographic location and race/ethnicity. Relative (risk ratio) and absolute (risk difference) measures were used to investigate racial disparities of childhood cancer late-stage diagnosis in small geographic areas (census tracts). The study investigated childhood cancer yearly incidence- and late-stage diagnosis rates for three racial groups combined. The study also analyzed the temporal change of childhood cancer late-stage diagnosis rates based on the data from census tracts where disparities existed for Hispanics and non-Hispanic African Americans compared with a non-Hispanic white reference group.','A total of 54% of the cases in the study cohort were diagnosed in the late stage. Although there were fewer non-Hispanic African Americans cases compared with non-Hispanic white and Hispanic cases, they showed significant geographic variation in racial/ethnic disparities compared with the non-Hispanic white reference group. The study also revealed that 58 census tracts for non-Hispanic African Americans and 47 census tracts for Hispanics (of 5265) had significantly higher late-stage diagnosis rates compared with non-Hispanic whites. The findings also demonstrated consistent increases in incidence and late-stage diagnosis from 2005 to 2014 for all cases combined.','Most of the significant census tracts with a higher late-stage diagnosis rate for Hispanics were located on the outskirts of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio areas. In contrast, geographic disparities of childhood cancer late-stage diagnosis for non-Hispanic African Americans were found inside the large metropolitan areas of Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth. The findings of this study will help prioritize the geographical allocation of resources, which, in turn, will help to facilitate preventive healthcare services and alleviate the disease burden in children."
"Despite declining HIV infection rates, persistent racial and ethnic disparities remain. Appropriate calculations of diagnosis rates by HIV transmission category, race and ethnicity, and geography are needed to monitor progress towards reducing systematic disparities in health outcomes. We estimated the number of heterosexually active adults (HAAs) by sex and state to calculate appropriate HIV diagnosis rates and disparity measures within subnational regions.','The analysis included all HIV diagnoses attributed to heterosexual transmission in 2018 in the United States, in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Logistic regression models estimated the probability of past-year heterosexual activity among adults in three national health surveys, by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, education category, and marital status. Model-based probabilities were applied to estimated counts of HAAs by state, which were synthesized through meta-analysis. HIV diagnoses were overlaid to calculate racial- and ethnic-specific rates, rate differences (RDs), and rate ratios (RRs) among HAAs by sex and state.','Nationally, HAA women have a two-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate than HAA men (rate per 100,000 HAAs, women: 6.57; men: 3.09). Compared to White non-Hispanic HAAs, Black HAAs have a 20-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 21.28, women: 19.55; RD, men: 15.40, women: 31.78) and Hispanic HAAs have a 4-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 4.68, RD, women: 4.15; RD, men: 2.79, RD, women: 5.39). Disparities were ubiquitous across regions, with >75% of states in each region having Black-to-White RR ≥10.','The racial and ethnic disparities across regions suggests a system-wide failure particularly with respect to preventing HIV among Black and Hispanic women. Pervasive disparities emphasize the role for coordinated federal responses such as the current Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative."
"In the US, racial disparities in outcomes following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are well documented. TRICARE insurance data represent a large population with universal insurance that allows for the robust assessment of the impact of such insurance on disparities in health care. This study examined racial differences in specific aspects of surgical care quality following CABG, using metrics endorsed by the National Quality Forum that included the prescription of beta-blockers and statins at discharge and thirty-day readmissions. There were no risk-adjusted differences in outcomes between African American and white patients insured through TRICARE. Our study provides a window into the potential impacts of universal insurance and an equal-access health care system on racial disparities in surgical care quality following CABG."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in adverse birth outcomes have persistently been wide and may be explained by individual and area-level factors. Our primary objective was to determine if county-level black-white segregation modified the association between maternal race/ethnicity and adverse birth outcomes using birth records from the National Center for Health Statistics (2012). Based on maternal residence at birth, county-level black-white racial residential segregation was calculated along five dimensions of segregation: evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering. We conducted a two-stage analysis: (1) county-specific logistic regression to determine whether maternal race and ethnicity were associated with preterm birth and term low birth weight; and (2) Bayesian meta-analyses to determine if segregation moderated these associations. We found greater black-white and Hispanic-white disparities in preterm birth in racially isolated counties (exposure) relative to non-isolated counties. We found reduced Hispanic-white disparities in term low birth weight in racially concentrated and centralized counties relative to non-segregated counties. Area-level poverty explained most of the moderating effect of segregation on disparities in adverse birth outcomes, suggesting that area-level poverty is a mediator of these associations. Segregation appears to modify racial/ethnic disparities in adverse birth outcomes. Therefore, policy interventions that reduce black-white racial isolation, or buffer the poor social and economic correlates of segregation, may help to reduce disparities in preterm birth and term low birth weight."
"Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are evident across many service domains including access to early assessment, diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions. To better understand the complex social and structural factors contributing to these disparities, this article offers a systematic review of peer-reviewed qualitative research conducted from 2010 to 2016 in the United States that investigates autism disparities experienced by marginalized communities. Based on these criteria, we identified 24 qualitative research studies and conducted an analysis using meta-ethnography and an intersectional interpretive lens. We identified three interdependent themes contributing to autism disparities, including familial, cultural, and structural barriers. Omissions in the literature were also evident, including a lack of research on underserved adults with ASD and the gendered inequities of caregiving. We discuss the implications of our findings and offer new questions that take an intersectional approach using qualitative research to investigate autism disparities."
"There are marked disparities between black and nonblack women in the United States in birth outcomes. Yet, there are little data on methods to reduce these disparities. Although the cause of racial disparities in health is multifactorial, implicit bias is thought to play a contributing role. To target differential management, studies in nonobstetrical populations have demonstrated disparity reduction through care standardization. With wide variation by site and provider, labor management practices are the ideal target for standardization.','In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a standardized induction of labor protocol on racial disparities in cesarean delivery rate and maternal and neonatal morbidity.','We performed a prospective cohort study of women undergoing an induction from 2013 to 2015. Full-term (≥37 weeks' gestation) women carrying a singleton pregnancy with intact membranes and an unfavorable cervix (dilation ≤2 cm, Bishop score of ≤6) were included. We compared the cesarean delivery rate and maternal and neonatal morbidity between 2 groups stratified by race (black vs nonblack) as follows: (1) women induced in a randomized trial (n=491) that utilized an induction protocol with standardized recommendations for interventions such as oxytocin and amniotomy at particular time points and (2) women in an observational arm (n=364) enrolled at the same time whose induction and labor management occurred at provider discretion. Regression modeling was used to test an interaction between the induction protocol and race.','A significant reduction in cesarean delivery rate in black women managed with the induction protocol was noted when compared with those in the observational group (25.7% vs 34.2%; P=.02), whereas there was no difference in cesarean delivery rate in nonblack women (34.6% vs 29.9%; P=.41). The induction protocol reduced the racial disparity in cesarean delivery rate (interaction term, P=.04), even when controlling for parity, body mass index, indication for labor induction, and Bishop score at induction start. In addition, a significant reduction in neonatal morbidity was found in black women managed with the induction protocol (2.9% vs 8.9%; P=.001), with no difference in nonblack women (3.6% vs 5.5%; P=.55). The induction protocol did not significantly affect maternal morbidity for either race.','A standardized induction protocol is associated with reduced cesarean delivery rate and neonatal morbidity in black women undergoing induction. Further studies should determine whether implementation of induction protocols in diverse settings could reduce national racial disparities in obstetrical outcomes."
"Stunting continues to be a prominent health problem in Indonesia. Stunting prevalence is higher in children from poor families or living in rural areas; however, there has been a lack of information on predictors of stunting disparities and stunting risk factors by socioeconomic status (SES) and location of residence (rural or urban). This study aims to examine the factors associated with stunting by SES and rural-urban status, and to assess determinants of stunting disparities by SES and rural-urban status in Indonesia.','This study analysed data from the Indonesian Family and Life Survey (IFLS) wave 5, conducted in 2014. Data for 3887 children aged 0-59 months, including individual, family and community variables, were analysed. Stratified logistic regression was conducted to assess differences in determinants of stunting by household expenditure (poor or non-poor, representing SES) and rural-urban status. The Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method was used to assess determinants of stunting disparities by household expenditure and rural-urban status.','The analyses showed differences in factors associated with stunting among children in rural versus urban areas, or children in poor versus non-poor households. Mother's short stature and low education level increased the odds of stunting across all groups. However, in children of families with a higher household expenditure, unhealthy snacks were a significant predictor of stunting (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.47). This finding was not found in other groups. Good sanitation significantly reduced stunting in children in families with higher household expenditure and children from urban communities. Nutrition services were significantly associated with stunting in poor children and children from urban areas. The decomposition analyses showed that differences in characteristics explained 55.35% stunting disparity by household expenditure. Meanwhile, rural-urban disparity was mostly explained by differences in responses (56.20%), with low birth weight and unexplained variables as predominant contributors.','There were slight differences in stunting determinants by household expenditure and rural-urban status in Indonesia. Stunting disparities were attributed to differences in characteristics and responses between the less and more advantaged populations. To improve the effectiveness of stunting reduction programs, specific interventions tailored to address the differences between the more and less advantaged population are needed."
"Most persistent poverty counties are rural and contain high concentrations of racial minorities. Cancer mortality across persistent poverty, rurality, and race is understudied.','We gathered data on race and cancer deaths (all sites; lung and bronchus; colorectal; liver and intrahepatic bile duct; oropharyngeal; breast and cervical [females]; and prostate [males]) from National Death Index (1990-1992; 2014-2018). We linked these data to county characteristics: a) persistent poverty or not and b) rural or urban. We calculated absolute (range difference) and relative (range ratio) disparities for each cancer mortality outcome across persistent poverty, rurality, race, and time.','The 1990-1992 range difference for all sites combined indicated persistent poverty counties had 12.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]=11.37-14.09) excess deaths per 100,000 people/year compared to non-persistent poverty counties; the 2014-2018 range difference was 10.99 (95% CI = 10.22-11.77). Similarly, the 1990-1992 range ratio for all sites indicated mortality rates in persistent poverty counties were 1.06 (95% CI = 1.05-1.07) times as high as non-persistent poverty counties; the 2014-2018 range ratio was 1.07 (95% CI = 1.07-1.08). Between 1990-1992 and 2014-2018, absolute and relative disparities by persistent poverty widened for colorectal and breast cancers; however, for remaining outcomes, trends in disparities were stable or mixed. The highest mortality rates were observed among African American/Black residents of rural, persistent poverty counties for all sites, colorectal, oropharyngeal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancers.','Mortality disparities by persistent poverty endured over time for most cancer outcomes, particularly for racial minorities in rural, persistent poverty counties. Multisector interventions are needed to improve cancer outcomes."
"Quantifying disparities in health information technology (HIT) use among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients may help clinicians reduce care gaps and improve outcomes.','Relationships between HIT usage and sociodemographic characteristics were studied for adults with HNC between 2011 and 2018 through a retrospective analysis of the US National Health Interview Survey.','Multivariate logistic regression indicated HIT usage disparities based on race, age, educational attainment, and insurance status. Black (aOR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.52, P = 0.010), uninsured (aOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.79, P = 0.022), and senior patients (aOR 2.72, 95% CI 1.55-4.80, P < 0.001) emailed providers less than non-Hispanic White, privately insured, and middle-aged (45-64) patients, respectively. Similar disparities were found among patients searching for health information, scheduling appointments, and filling prescriptions online.','Black, older, less educated, and un/underinsured HNC patients use HIT less than their counterparts. Reducing these inequities may help improve their outcomes."
"Biological aging is a proposed mechanism through which social determinants drive health disparities. We conducted proof-of-concept testing of 8 DNA-methylation (DNAm) and blood-chemistry quantifications of biological aging as mediators of disparities in healthspan between Black and White participants in the 2016 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (n = 9,005). We quantified biological aging from 4 DNAm ""clocks"" (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge clock), a DNAm pace-of-aging measure (DunedinPoAm), and 3 blood-chemistry measures (PhenoAge, Klemera-Doubal method biological age, and homeostatic dysregulation). We quantified Black-White disparities in healthspan from cross-sectional and longitudinal data on physical performance tests, self-reported limitations in activities of daily living, and physician-diagnosed chronic diseases, self-rated health, and survival. DNAm and blood-chemistry quantifications of biological aging were moderately correlated (Pearson's r = 0.1-0.4). The GrimAge clock, DunedinPoAm, and all 3 blood-chemistry measures were associated with healthspan characteristics (e.g., mortality effect-size hazard ratios were 1.71-2.32 per standard deviation of biological aging) and showed evidence of more advanced/faster biological aging in Black participants than in White participants (Cohen's d = 0.4-0.5). These measures accounted for 13%-95% of Black-White differences in healthspan-related characteristics. Findings suggest that reducing disparities in biological aging can contribute to building health equity."
"Several studies have identified disparities in pancreatic cancer treatment associated with gender, race, and ethnicity. There are limited data examining disparities in short-term adverse outcomes after pancreatic resection for cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate associations of gender, race, and ethnicity with morbidity and mortality after pancreatic resection for malignancy.','The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database was retrospectively reviewed.

Morbidity and major morbidity after distal pancreatectomy are associated with the male gender. Morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy is independently associated with male gender, Asian race, and Hispanic ethnicity; major morbidity is independently associated with male gender and Asian race, and mortality is independently associated with Hispanic ethnicity.','Gender, race, and ethnicity are independently associated with morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer; gender and race are independently associated with major morbidity; and ethnicity is independently associated with mortality.

"The goal of this study was to illustrate the potential benefit of effective congestive heart failure (CHF) treatment in terms of improved health, greater social value, and reduced health disparities between black and white subpopulations.','CHF affects 5.7 million Americans, costing $32 billion annually in treatment expenditures and lost productivity. CHF also contributes to health disparities between black and white Americans: black subjects develop CHF at a younger age and are more likely to be hospitalized and die of this disease. Improved CHF treatment could generate significant health benefits and reduce health disparities.','We adapted an established economic-demographic microsimulation to estimate scenarios in which a hypothetical innovation eliminates the incidence of CHF and, separately, 6 other diseases in patients 51 to 52 years of age in 2016. This cohort was followed up until death. We estimated total life years, quality-adjusted life years, and disability-free life years with and without the innovation, for the population overall and for race- and sex-defined subpopulations.','CHF prevalence among 65- to 70-year-olds increased from 4.3% in 2012 to 8.5% in 2030. Diagnosis with CHF coincided with significant increases in disability and medical expenditures, particularly among black subjects. Preventing CHF among those 51 to 52 years of age in 2016 would generate nearly 2.9 million additional life years, 1.1 million disability-free life years, and 2.1 million quality-adjusted life years worth $210 to $420 billion. These gains are greater among black subjects than among white subjects.','CHF prevalence will increase substantially over the next 2 decades and will affect black Americans more than white Americans. Improved CHF treatment could generate significant social value and reduce existing health disparities."
"Racial health disparities in obesity and obesity-related conditions and behaviors are well documented, although a small body of research suggests that geographic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES] and rural/urban status) may alter the magnitude of these disparities.','This study explored how rurality moderates black/white health disparities using a nationally representative sample from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (<i>n</i>=359,157). Respondents' county of residence was linked to the U.S. Census information to obtain the county-level Index of Relative Rurality (IRR). Weighted logistic regression was used to model obesity, diabetes, and lack of physical activity (PA) on race (black/white), IRR, and an interaction term of race and IRR, including covariates (age, sex, education, marital status, employment, and income).','Blacks were significantly more likely to have obesity, diabetes, and a lack of PA compared with whites. Irrespective of race, rural respondents were significantly more likely to have obesity (odds ratio [OR] 1.035, confidence interval [95% CI] 1.028-1.043) and a lack of PA (OR 1.045, 95% CI 1.038-1.053) than respondents in more urban areas. For obesity and diabetes, the interaction term for black×IRR quintile was significant and positive, indicating an increase in the magnitude of the black/white disparity with increasing rurality.','These findings underscore the need for policies and programs aimed to reduce racial disparities in obesity and related conditions to consider the geographic context in which these outcomes occur."
"Healthcare disparities in multiethnic medical data is a major challenge; the main reason lies in the unequal data distribution of ethnic groups among data cohorts. Biomedical data collected from different cancer genome research projects may consist of mainly one ethnic group, such as people with European ancestry. In contrast, the data distribution of other ethnic races such as African, Asian, Hispanic, and Native Americans can be less visible than the counterpart. Data inequality in the biomedical field is an important research problem, resulting in the diverse performance of machine learning models while creating healthcare disparities. Previous researches have reduced the healthcare disparities only using limited data distributions. In our study, we work on fine-tuning of deep learning and transfer learning models with different multiethnic data distributions for the prognosis of 33 cancer types. In previous studies, to reduce the healthcare disparities, only a single ethnic cohort was used as the target domain with one major source domain. In contrast, we focused on multiple ethnic cohorts as the target domain in transfer learning using the TCGA and MMRF CoMMpass study datasets. After performance comparison for experiments with new data distributions, our proposed model shows promising performance for transfer learning schemes compared to the baseline approach for old and new data distributation experiments."
"The primary lung allocation unit was expanded from the donation service area to a 250-mile radius in 2017. Prior to the change, geographic disparities in donor lung availability impacted waitlist outcomes. We sought to determine if the new allocation system improved these disparities.','We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing the 2-year period before and after the change. Donor lung availability was defined as the ratio of donor lungs to waitlist candidates in the primary allocation unit. Transplant centers were divided into quartiles by donor lung availability. Multivariable competing risk models were used to determine the association between lung availability and waitlist outcomes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models compared post-transplant survival.','Prior to the allocation change, the unadjusted transplant rate at centers in the lowest and highest quartiles was 132 and 607 transplants per 100 waitlist years. Candidates in the lowest quartile of donor lung availability had a 61% adjusted lower transplantation rate compared to candidates in highest quartile (sub-hazard ratio [sHR]: 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.44). After the allocation change, the disparity decreased resulting in an unadjusted transplant rate of 141 and 309 among centers in the lowest and highest quartiles. Candidates in the lowest quartile had a 38% adjusted lower transplantation rate compared to those in the highest (sHR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.57-0.68). There was no significant difference in 1-year post-transplant survival.','Although the expansion of the primary allocation unit improved disparities in waitlist outcomes without any change in post-transplant survival, there still remain significant differences due to geography."
"Disparities in outcomes exist for breast, colon, and lung cancer among diverse populations, particularly racial and ethnic underrepresented minorities (URMs) and individuals from lower socioeconomic status. For example, blacks experience mortality rates up to about 42% higher than whites for these cancers. Furthermore, although overall death rates have been declining, the differential access to screening and care has aggravated disparities. Our purpose is to assess how the coverage policies of CMS and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) influence these disparities. Additionally, barriers are often encountered in accessing screening tests and receiving prompt treatment. To narrow, and potentially eliminate, outcomes disparities, CMS and USPSTF could consider revising their decision-making processes regarding coverage. Some options include (1) extending their evidence base to include observational studies that involve groups at higher risk; (2) lowering the threshold ages for screening to encompass differences in incidence; (3) CMS approving screening CT colonography coverage, which can even increase compliance with other screening tests; (4) clarifying and streamlining guidelines; (5) supporting research on improving access to screening; and (6) encouraging the development of more navigation services for URMs."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to demonstrate racial disparities in incidence and survival in the United States. This study investigates the role of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage in racial disparities in CRC incidence in Louisiana.','Louisiana Tumor Registry and U.S. Census data were used to assess the incidence of CRC diagnosed in individuals 35 years and older between 2008 and 2012. Neighborhood concentrated disadvantage index (CDI) was calculated based on the PhenX Toolkit protocol. The incidence of CRC was modeled using multilevel binomial regression with individuals nested within neighborhoods.','Our study included 10,198 cases of CRC. Adjusting for age and sex, CRC risk was 28% higher for blacks than whites (risk ratio [RR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-1.33). One SD increase in CDI was associated with 14% increase in risk for whites (RR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.10-1.18) and 5% increase for blacks (RR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.09). After controlling for differential effects of CDI by race, racial disparities were not observed in disadvantaged areas.','CRC incidence increased with neighborhood disadvantage and racial disparities diminished with mounting disadvantage. Our results suggest additional dimensions to racial disparities in CRC outside of neighborhood disadvantage that warrants further research."
"Racial disparities in endometrial cancer are stark and have increased over the past decade. While the disparities are well documented, intervention work to address the mortality gap is nonexistent. This review critiques how race has been conceptualized to explain the causes of endometrial cancer disparities, assesses gaps in knowledge production, and proposes new research priorities. Using public health critical race praxis, a research approach for examining racial disparities and knowledge production processes, we reviewed the endometrial cancer disparities literature from 1995 through 2016. Using systematic search methods, 133 unique records were identified and 48 studies critiqued. We found that a narrow definition of race as a purely biological construct is common throughout the literature. This appears to result in an underemphasis on the role of modifiable, nonbiological contributors to racial disparities and a lack of follow-up work to address these contributors. Key knowledge gaps identified were the role of health care systems in early diagnosis, a lack of intervention studies to address persistent treatment inequity by race, and the near absence of qualitative work to understand the perspectives of Black women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. We conclude with an iterative demonstration of the public health critical race praxis and suggest new routes of inquiry to broaden the scope of research priorities to understand and improve the outcomes of Black women with endometrial cancer."
"A growing body of literature has reported widening educational health disparities across birth cohorts or time periods in the United States, but has paid little attention to the implication of mortality selection on the cohort trend in health disparities.','This study investigates how changes in the variance of unobserved frailty over time may complicate the interpretation of cohort trends in health disparities and life expectancy.','We use the microsimulation method to test the effect of mortality selection and further propose a counterfactual simulation procedure to estimate its contribution. Data used in the simulations are based on Panel Studies of Income Dynamics 1968-2013, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data 1999-2012, and National Health Interview Survey data 1986-2011.','Simulation shows that mortality selection may generate seemingly contradictory trends in health disparities and life expectancy across birth cohorts at the group and individual level. Life expectancy can change even when individual mortality curve is fixed. In the absence of a change in the causal effect of education on mortality at the individual level, an educational life expectancy gap can change across cohorts as a result of the change in frailty variance. Empirical analysis shows that mortality selection accounts for a sizeable amount of contribution to the widening educational life expectancy gap from the 1950s to 1960s birth cohorts in the United States.','We demonstrate mortality selection can complicate the cohort trend in health disparities and life expectancy and propose a counterfactual simulation method to evaluate its contribution."
"Racial disparities have been reported in liver transplantation and chronic hepatitis C treatment outcomes. Determining causes of these disparities is important given the racially diverse American population and the economic burden associated with chronic liver disease.','A retrospective study was performed among 463 patients diagnosed with cirrhosis admitted from (January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2018) to a tertiary care academic medical center. Patients were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for cirrhosis or its complications. Demographic information, laboratory data, medical comorbidities, insurance and adherence to cirrhosis quality care indicators were recorded to determine their relationship to readmission rates and other healthcare outcomes.','A total of 463 individual patients with cirrhosis were identified including Whites (n = 241), Hispanics (n = 106), Blacks (n = 50), Asian and Pacific Islander Americans (API, n = 27) and Other (n = 39). A significantly higher proportion of Blacks had Medicaid insurance compared to Whites (40% versus 20%, p = 0.0002) and Blacks had lower median income than Whites ($45,710 versus $54,844, p = 0.01). All groups received high quality cirrhosis care. Regarding healthcare outcomes, Black patients had the highest mean total hospital admissions (6.1 ± 6.3, p = 0.01) and the highest mean number of 30-day re-admissions (2.1 ± 3.7, p = 0.05) compared to all other racial groups. Multivariable proportional odds regression analysis showed that race was a statistically significant predictor of 90-day readmission (p = 0.03).','Black Americans hospitalized for complications of cirrhosis may experience significant disparities in healthcare outcomes compared to Whites despite high quality cirrhosis care. Socioeconomic factors may contribute to these disparities."
"What services are available and where racial and ethnic minorities receive long-term services and supports (LTSS) have resulted in a lower quality of care and life for racial/ethnic minority users. These disparities are only likely to worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority communities both in the rate of infection and virus-related mortality. By examining these disparities in the context of the pandemic, we bring to light the challenges and issues faced in LTSS by minority communities with regard to this virus as well as the disparities in LTSS that have always existed."
"Eliminating persistent racial/ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity is a public health priority. National strategies to improve maternal outcomes are increasingly focused on quality improvement collaboratives. However, the effectiveness of quality collaboratives for reducing racial disparities in maternity care is understudied.','To evaluate the impact of a hemorrhage quality-improvement collaborative on racial disparities in severe maternal morbidity from hemorrhage.','We conducted a cross-sectional study from 2011 to 2016 among 99 hospitals that participated in a hemorrhage quality improvement collaborative in California. The focus of the quality collaborative was to implement the national maternal hemorrhage safety bundle consisting of 17 evidence-based recommendations for practice and care processes known to improve outcomes. This analysis included 54,311 women from the baseline period (January 2011 through December 2014) and 19,165 women from the postintervention period (October 2015 through December 2016) with a diagnosis of obstetric hemorrhage during delivery hospitalization. We examined whether racial/ethnic-specific severe maternal morbidity rates in these women with obstetric hemorrhage were reduced from the baseline to the postintervention period. In addition, we conducted Poisson Generalized Estimating Equation models to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for severe maternal morbidity comparing each racial/ethnic group with white.','During the baseline period, the rate of severe maternal morbidity among women with hemorrhage was 22.1% (12,002/54,311) with the greatest rate observed among black women (28.6%, 973/3404), and the lowest among white women (19.8%, 3124/15,775). The overall rate fell to 18.5% (3553/19,165) in the postintervention period. Both black and white mothers benefited from the intervention, but the benefit among black women exceeded that of white women (9.0% vs 2.1% absolute rate reduction). The baseline risk of severe maternal morbidity was 1.34 times greater among black mothers compared with white mothers (relative risk, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-1.42), and it was reduced to 1.22 (1.05-1.40) in the postintervention period. Sociodemographic and clinical factors explained a part of the black-white differences. After controlling for these factors, the black-white relative risk was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.30) at baseline and narrowed to 1.07 (1.92-1.24) in the postintervention period. Results were similar when excluding severe maternal morbidity cases with transfusion alone. After accounting for maternal risk factors, the black-white relative risk for severe maternal morbidity excluding transfusion alone was reduced from a baseline of 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.52) to 0.99 (0.76-1.29) in the postintervention period. The most important clinical risk factor for disparate black rates for both severe maternal morbidity and severe maternal morbidity excluding transfusion alone was cesarean delivery, potentially providing another opportunity for quality improvement.','A large-scale quality improvement collaborative reduced rates of severe maternal morbidity due to hemorrhage in all races and reduced the performance gap between black and white women. Improving access to highly effective treatments has the potential to decrease disparities for care-sensitive acute hospital-focused morbidities."
"Payment systems generally do not directly encourage or support the reduction of health disparities. In 2013 the Finding Answers: Solving Disparities through Payment and Delivery System Reform program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation sought to understand how alternative payment models might intentionally incorporate a disparities-reduction component to promote health equity. A qualitative analysis of forty proposals to the program revealed that applicants generally did not link payment reform tightly to disparities reduction. Most proposed general pay-for-performance, global payment, or shared savings plans, combined with multicomponent system interventions. None of the applicants proposed making any financial payments contingent on having successfully reduced disparities. Most applicants did not address how they would optimize providers' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to reduce disparities. A better understanding of how payment and care delivery models might be designed and implemented to reduce health disparities is essential."
"Racial disparities in resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are well documented. Patient-level and system-level factors only partially explain these findings. Although physician-related factors have been suggested as mediators, empirical evidence for their contribution is limited.','To determine if racial disparities in receipt of thoracic surgery persisted after patients had a surgical consultation and whether there was a physician contribution to disparities in care.','The authors identified 19,624 patients with stage I-II NSCLC above 65 years of age from the Surveillance-Epidemiology and End-Results-Medicare database. They studied black and white patients evaluated by a surgeon within 6 months of diagnosis. They assessed for racial differences in resection rates among surgeons using hierarchical linear modeling. Our main outcome was receipt of NSCLC resection. A random intercept was included to test for variability in resection rates across surgeons. Interaction between patient race and the random surgeon intercept was used to evaluate for heterogeneity between surgeons in resection rates for black versus white patients.','After surgical consultation, black patients were less likely to undergo resection (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.69). Resection rates varied significantly between surgeons (P<0.001). A significant interaction between the surgeon intercept and race (P<0.05) showed variability beyond chance across surgeons in resection rates of black versus white patients. When the model included thoracic surgery specifalization the physician contribution to disparities in care was decreased.','Racial disparities in resection of NSCLC exist even among patients who had access to a surgeon. Heterogeneity between surgeons in resection rates between black and white patients suggests a physician's contribution to observed racial disparities. Specialization in thoracic surgery attenuated this contribution."
"Colorectal cancer is curable if diagnosed early and treated properly. Black and Hispanic patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to experience treatment delays and/or receive lower standards of care. Socioeconomic deprivation may contribute to these disparities, but this has not been extensively quantified. We studied the interrelationship between patient race/ethnicity and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) on receipt of timely appropriate treatment among patients with colorectal cancer in California.','White, Black, and Hispanic patients (26,870) diagnosed with stage I-III colorectal cancer (2009-2013) in the California Cancer Registry were included. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association of race/ethnicity and nSES with three outcomes: undertreatment, >60-day treatment delay, and >90-day treatment delay. Joint effect models and mediation analysis were used to explore the interrelationships between race/ethnicity and nSES.','Hispanics and Blacks were at increased risk for undertreatment [Black OR = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23-1.57; Hispanic OR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.08-1.27] and treatment delay (Black/60-day OR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.57-2.02; Hispanic/60-day OR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.38-1.64) compared with Whites. Of the total effect (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.07-1.24) of non-white race on undertreatment, 45.71% was explained by nSES.','Lower nSES patients of any race were at substantially higher risk for undertreatment and treatment delay, and racial/ethnic disparities are reduced or eliminated among non-white patients living in the highest SES neighborhoods. Racial and ethnic disparities persisted after accounting for neighborhood socioeconomic status, and between the two, race/ethnicity explained a larger portion of the total effects.','This research improves our understanding of how socioeconomic deprivation contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer."
"To review current US literature and describe the extent, source, and impact of disparities that exist among Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in surgical route and outcomes for hysterectomy, myomectomy, and endometriosis surgery.','Despite the nationwide trend toward minimally invasive surgery (MIS), BIPOC women are disproportionally less likely to undergo MIS hysterectomy and myomectomy and have higher rates of perioperative complications. African American women, in particular, receive significantly disparate care. Contemporary literature on the prevalence of endometriosis in BIPOC women is lacking. Further, there is little data on the racial and ethnic differences in endometriosis surgery access and outcomes.','Racial and ethnic disparities in access to minimally invasive gynecologic surgery for benign pathology exist and these differences are not fully accounted for by patient, socioeconomic, or healthcare infrastructure factors. Initiatives that incentivize hiring surgeons trained to perform complex gynecologic surgery, standardized pathways for route of surgery, quality improvement focused on increased hospital MIS volume, and hospital-based public reporting of MIS volume data may be of benefit for minimizing disparities. Further, initiatives to reduce disparities need to address racism, implicit bias, and healthcare structural issues that perpetuate disparities."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. However, percutaneous interventional cardiovascular therapies are often underutilized in Blacks, Hispanics, and women and may contribute to excess morbidity and mortality in these vulnerable populations. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) is committed to reducing racial, ethnic, and sex-based treatment disparities in interventional cardiology patients. Accordingly, each of the SCAI Clinical Interest Councils (coronary, peripheral, structural, and congenital heart disease [CHD]) participated in the development of this whitepaper addressing disparities in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in underserved populations. The councils were charged with summarizing the available data on prevalence, treatment, and outcomes and elucidating potential reasons for any disparities. Given the huge changes in racial and ethnic composition by age in the United States (Figure 1), it was difficult to determine disparities in rates of diagnosis and we expected to find some racial differences in prevalence of disease. For example, since the average age of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is 80 years, one may expect 80% of TAVR patients to be non-Hispanic White. Conversely, only 50% of congenital heart interventions would be expected to be performed in non-Hispanic Whites. Finally, we identified opportunities for SCAI to advance clinical care and equity for our patients, regardless of sex, ethnicity, or race."
"A substantial and growing body of literature explores health disparities in radiology and imaging. The term ""health disparities"" refers to health differences related to disadvantages experienced by vulnerable populations, often caused by underlying social determinants of health. As such, health disparities are often closely tied to issues of social justice. Radiologists can work to reduce health disparities in different ways, including through supporting education, diversity and inclusion efforts, disparities research, and advocacy."
"Although the incidence of lung cancer has decreased over the past decades, disparities in survival and treatment modalities have been observed for black and white patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, despite the fact that surgical resection has been established as the standard of care. Possible contributors to these disparities are stage at diagnosis, comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and patient preference. This study examines racial disparities in treatment, adjusting for clinicodemographic factors.','The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare dataset was queried to identify patients diagnosed with primary stage I non-small cell lung cancer between 1992 and 2009. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess the association between race and treatment modalities within 1 year of diagnosis, adjusted for clinical and demographic factors. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were performed to evaluate disparities in survival, accounting for mode of treatment.','We identified 22,724 patients; 21,230 (93.4%) white and 1494 (6.6%) black.

"Despite national efforts to redress racial/ethnic disparities, Latino Americans continue to share a disproportionate burden of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of underlying causes and influencing factors is needed to guide future efforts to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes control. The objectives of this review are: (1) to summarize our understanding of determinants and modifiable predictors of glycemic control; (2) to provide an overview of existing strategies to reduce diabetes-related disparities; and (3) to identify gaps in the literature regarding whether these interventions effectively address disparities in US Latino populations. Key findings include evidence that diabetes care services can be designed to accommodate heterogeneity within the Latino American community by addressing key modifiable predictors of poor glycemic control, including insurance status, diabetes care utilization, patient self-management, language access, culturally appropriate care, and social support services. Future research efforts should evaluate the effect of structurally tailored interventions that address these key modifiable predictors by targeting patients, providers, and health care delivery systems."
"In the United States, state-level policies requiring vaccination of school-going children constitute a critical strategy for improving vaccination coverage. However, policies allowing vaccination exemptions have also been implemented and contribute to reductions in vaccination coverage and potential increases in the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. Understanding the geographic disparities in the distribution of vaccination exemptions and identifying high risk areas is necessary for guiding resource allocation and public health control strategies. This study investigated geographic disparities in vaccination exemptions as well as socioeconomic and demographic predictors of vaccination exemptions in Florida.','Vaccination exemption data were obtained from the Florida Department of Health's Florida HealthCHARTS web interface. Spatial patterns in geographic distribution of total and non-medical vaccination exemptions were assessed using county-level choropleth maps. Negative binomial models were used to identify significant predictors of county-level risks of both total and non-medical vaccination exemptions.','Total exemptions varied from 0 to 30.2 per 10,000 people. Nine counties had exemption risks in the top two classes (10.4-15.9 and 15.9-30.2 exemptions per 10,000 people). These counties were distributed in five distinct areas: Western Panhandle, central northern area, central, South-eastern coastal area, and the southern coastal border of the state. Non-medical exemptions varied from 0 to 10.4 per 10,000 people. Fifteen counties had exemption risks in the top two classes (3.7-5.6 and 5.6-10.4 exemptions per 10,000 people), and were located in six distinct areas: Western and Central Panhandle, Northeastern, Central-eastern coastal area, Central-western coastal area, and the South-western coastal border of the state. Predictors of high risk of total vaccination exemptions were high density of primary care providers (<i>p</i> < 0.001), high median income (<i>p</i> = 0.001), high percentage of Hispanic population (<i>p</i> = 0.046), and low percentage of population with a college education (<i>p</i> = 0.013). A predictor of high risk of non-medical vaccination exemptions was high percentage of White population (<i>p</i> = 0.045). However, predictors of low risks of non-medical exemptions were high percentages of population: living in rural areas (<i>p</i> = 0.023), with college education (<i>p</i> = 0.013), with high school education (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and with less than high school education (<i>p</i> < 0.001).','There is evidence of county-level geographic disparities in both total and non-medical vaccination exemption risks in Florida. These disparities are explained by differences in county-level socioeconomic and demographic factors.

"Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients present with kidney failure at younger ages than White patients. Younger patients are also more likely to receive transplants and home dialysis than in-center hemodialysis (ICHD), but it is unknown whether racial and ethnic disparities in treatment differ by age. We compared use of kidney replacement therapies between racial and ethnic groups among patients with incident kidney failure overall and by age.','Retrospective cohort study.','830,402 US adult (age >21 years) patients initiating kidney failure treatment during the period of 2011-2018.','Patient race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, or other) and age group (22-44, 45-64, 65-74, or 75-99 years).','Treatment modality (transplant, peritoneal dialysis [PD], home hemodialysis [HHD], or ICHD) as of day 90 of treatment.','Differences in treatment modalities were quantified for patient subgroups defined by race and ethnicity and by age. Log-binomial regression models were fit to estimate adjusted risk ratios.','81% of patients were treated with ICHD, 3.0% underwent transplants (85% preemptive, 57% living-donor), 10.5% were treated with PD, and 0.7% were treated with HHD.

Compared with non-Hispanic White patients, whose percentages of treatment with transplant, PD, and HHD were 10.9%, 19.0%, and 1.2%, respectively, non-Hispanic Black patients were less commonly treated with each modality (unadjusted percentages, 1.8%, 13.8%, and 0.6%, respectively), as were Hispanic patients (4.4%, 16.9%, and 0.5%, respectively; all differences P < 0.001). After adjustment, the largest relative disparities were observed for transplant among the 22-44-year age group; compared with non-Hispanic White patients, the adjusted risk ratios for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients were 0.21 (95% CI, 0.19-0.23) and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.43, 0.51), respectively.','Race and ethnicity data not self-reported.','Among adults with incident kidney failure, racial and ethnic disparities in transplant and home dialysis use are most pronounced among the youngest adult patient age group."
"Disparate colorectal cancer outcomes persist in vulnerable populations. We aimed to examine the distribution of research across the colorectal cancer care continuum, and to determine disparities in the utilization of Surgery among Black patients.','A systematic review and meta-analysis of colorectal cancer disparities studies was performed. The meta-analysis assessed three utilization measures in Surgery.','Of 1,199 publications, 60% focused on Prevention, Screening, or Diagnosis, 20% on Survivorship, 15% on Treatment, and 1% on End-of-Life Care. A total of 16 studies, including 1,110,674 patients, were applied to three meta-analyses regarding utilization of Surgery. Black patients were less likely to receive surgery, twice as likely to refuse surgery, and less likely to receive laparoscopic surgery, when compared to White patients.','Since 2011, the majority of research focused on prevention, screening, or diagnosis. Given the observed treatment disparities among Black patients, future efforts to reduce colorectal cancer disparities should include interventions within Surgery."
"The American Journal of Epidemiology has been a platform for findings from the Black Women's Health Study relevant to health disparities. Topics addressed have included methods of follow-up of a large cohort of Black women, disparities in health care delivery, modifiable risk factors for health conditions that disproportionately affect Black women, associations with exposures that are highly prevalent in Black women, and methods for genetics research. Black Women's Health Study papers have also highlighted the importance of considering social context, including perceived experiences of racism, in understanding health disparities. In the future, Black Women's Health Study investigators will contribute to documentation of the role that structural racism plays in health disparities."
"Significant disparities exist in lung cancer incidence and screening. Geographic, racial, gender, and socioeconomic disparities affect lung cancer incidence. As the leading cause of lung cancer, smoking varies among different racioethnic groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. In addition, environmental pollutants, such as radon, industrial toxins, and air pollution, are significant risk factors for lung cancer development that is disproportionately seen in working-class communities, as well as underserved and disabled populations. Lung cancer incidence depends on diagnosis. Literature examining lung cancer incidence and screening disparities have its limitations, as most studies are methodologically limited and do not adjust for important risk factors."
"The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) require medical schools to teach their students how to recognize and work toward eliminating health disparities. However, time constraints and a dearth of guidance for educators in teaching pain disparities curricula pose significant challenges. Herein we describe successes and lessons learned after designing, implementing, and evaluating an innovative pain disparities curriculum that was embedded in a longitudinal health equity curriculum for third year medical school students at an academic institution. Although the curriculum was developed for medical school students, the concepts may be broadly applicable to other training settings such as residency and fellowship programs."
"Racial disparities in cognitive function are well documented, but factors driving these disparities remain underexplored. This study aims to quantify the extent to which cumulative stress exposures across the life course explain Black-White disparities in executive function and episodic memory in middle-aged and older adults.','Data were drawn from the 2004-2006 wave of the Midlife Development in the United States Study (MIDUS 2) and the MIDUS Refresher study (N = 5,947; 5,262 White and 685 Black). Cumulative stress exposures were assessed by 10 stressor domains (ie, childhood stress, stressful life events in adulthood, financial stress, work psychological stress, work physical stress, work-family conflicts, neighborhood disorder, relationship stress, perceived inequality, and perceived discrimination). Cognitive function was assessed using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone. Marginal structural models were used to quantify the proportion of the effect of race/ethnicity status on cognitive function mediated through cumulative stress exposures.','After adjusting for age, sex, and sample, on average, Black participants had lower levels of executive function (difference: -0.83 SD units, 95% CI: -0.91, -0.75) and episodic memory (difference: -0.53 SD units, 95% CI: -0.60, -0.45) scores than White participants. Cumulative stress exposures accounted for 8.4% of the disparity in executive function and 13.2% of the disparity in episodic memory.','Cumulative stress exposures across the life course explained modest proportions of Black-White disparities in cognitive function in this large cross-sectional study."
"<b>Introduction:</b> Sexual and behavioral health disparities have been consistently demonstrated between African American and White adults and between sexual minority and heterosexual communities in the United States; however, few studies using nationally representative samples have examined disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual adults within African American populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of sexual and behavioral health outcomes between sexual minority and heterosexual African American adults and to examine whether there were different patterns of disparities for African American sexual minority men and women, respectively. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed data from 4502 African American adults who participated in the 2001-2015 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using multivariable analyses, we examined differences in HIV, sexually transmitted infections, mental health, and substance use among African American sexual minority and heterosexual men and women. <b>Results:</b> After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, African American sexual minority men had significantly higher odds of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and poor mental health compared to their heterosexual male counterparts, whereas African American sexual minority women had significantly higher odds of Hepatitis C, poor mental health, and substance use compared to their heterosexual female counterparts. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings demonstrate notable sexual orientation disparities among African American adults. Disparities persisted beyond the role of sociodemographic factors, suggesting that further research utilizing an intersectional approach is warranted to understand the social determinants of adverse health outcomes among African American sexual minority men and women."
"Educational reformers all around the globe are continuously searching for ways to make schools more effective and efficient. In Germany, this movement has led to reforms that reduced overall school time of high track secondary schools from 9 to 8 years, which was compensated for by increasing average instruction time per week in lower secondary school (Grades 5-10). Based on prior research, we assumed that this reform might increase gender disparities in STEM-related outcomes, stress, and health because it required students to learn similar content in less amount of time. Therefore, we investigated how the school time reform affected gender disparities at the end of upper secondary school between 2011 and 2013. Specifically, we considered representative data of the last two cohorts who completed lower secondary school before the reform (<i>N</i> = 2,405) and the first two cohorts after the reform (<i>N</i> = 2,413) from the National Educational Panel Study. Potential differences in gender disparities were investigated for upper secondary school outcomes of subject-specific standardized test performance, self-concept, and interest in mathematics, biology and physics, as well as outcomes of school-related stress and health. Overall, we found substantial disparities between girls and boys, which seemed to change little after the reform. Exceptions were the statistically significant gender × reform interactions for one stress dimension (Overload) and two health dimensions (Overburdening and Achievement-related fear) which increased for both boys and girls, but more strongly for girls."
"Psychosocial distress is highly prevalent in cancer patients, approaching rates around 40% across various cancer sites according to multicenter studies. As such, distress screening procedures have been developed and implemented to identify and respond to cancer patients' psychosocial distress and concerns. However, many cancer patients continue to report unmet psychosocial needs suggesting gaps in connecting patients with psychosocial services. Presently, there is a paucity of research examining sex-based disparities in referral rates to behavioral oncology services, particularly for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients. Informed by gender role conflict and empirical literature documenting disparities in cancer care and treatment based on a variety of sociocultural variables, this study aimed to examine the presence of sex disparities in referral rates to behavioral oncology services for AYA cancer patients. Data for this study consisted of 1,700 AYA cancer patients (age 18-39) who completed a distress screening at a large cancer center of a teaching hospital in the Midwestern United. Results indicated that patient sex significantly predicted the odds of behavioral oncology referral (γ<sub>50</sub> = -0.95, Odds ratio = 2.60, <i>p</i> < 0.001). This finding indicates that female AYA cancer patients are 2.5 times more likely to be referred to behavioral oncology services compared to male AYA cancer patients after controlling for psychosocial distress and emotional, family, and practical problems. Additionally, we found that emotional problems significantly moderated the odds of referral for males and females (γ<sub>60</sub> = 0.37, Odds ratio = 1.44, <i>p</i> < 0.001), however the odds of referral for males who endorsed emotional problems were lower than males who did not endorse emotional problems. This contrasted with female AYA cancer patients where the endorsement of emotional problems increased the odds of referral to behavioral oncology services. Findings are discussed with particular focus on how to enhance equitable care and reduce sex and other sociocultural-based disparities in AYA psychosocial oncology."
"The objective of this article is to call for integrating biological pathways of social experiences in the concept model of cancer disparities and social determinants of health (SDH) fields. Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations experience more negative outcomes across the cancer continuum. Social conditions are instrumental in better understanding the contemporary and historical constructs that create these patterns of disparities. There is an equally important body of evidence that points to the ways that social conditions shape biological pathways. To date, these areas of research are, for the most part, separate. This paper calls for a bridging of these two areas of research to create new directions for the field of cancer disparities. We discuss inflammation, epigenetic changes, co-morbidities, and early onset as examples of the biological consequences of social conditions that BIPOC populations experience throughout their lifespan that may contribute to disproportionate tumorigenesis and tumor progression."
"Racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States have high renal cell carcinoma (RCC) mortality rates. This study assessed surgical treatment disparities across racial/ethnic groups and impacts of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics on surgical treatments and overall mortality. Stage I RCC patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2016 from National Cancer Database were included (n = 238,141). We assessed differences in associations between race/ethnicity and treatment patterns using logistic regression and between race/ethnicity and overall mortality using Cox regression with and without neighborhood characteristics in the regression models. When compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), American Indians/Alaska Natives and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) were more likely not to receive surgical care and all racial/ethnic minority groups had significantly increased odds of undergoing radical rather than partial nephrectomy, even after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics. Including surgical treatment and neighborhood factors in the models slightly attenuated the association, but NHBs had a significantly increased risk of overall mortality. NHBs who underwent radical nephrectomy had an increased risk of mortality (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08-1.23), but not for NHBs who underwent partial nephrectomy (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.84-1.02). Neighborhood factors were associated with surgical treatment patterns and overall mortality in both NHBs and NHWs. Neighborhood socioeconomic factors may only partly explain RCC disparities."
"Osteoporosis and fragility fractures result in significant morbidity and mortality and contribute to substantial healthcare costs. Despite being a treatable disease, osteoporosis remains both underdiagnosed and undertreated in the US general population, with significant disparities in care between non-White and White women. These disparities are evident from screening to post-fracture treatment. Non-White women are less likely to be screened for osteoporosis, to be prescribed pharmacotherapy, or to receive treatment post-fracture; furthermore, the mortality rate after fracture is higher in non-White women. Given existing diagnostic and treatment disparities, additional studies and interventions are needed to optimize the bone health of Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Native American women, and to reduce morbidity and mortality from osteoporosis and fragility fractures."
"There is limited literature regarding potential disparities in nonmelanoma skin cancer for patients with skin of color.','Use the sizes of Mohs micrographic surgery defects to examine disparities in nonmelanoma skin cancer among Hispanic/Latino patients with a secondary aim to examine the effect of insurance type.','We conducted a multicenter retrospective study using data from 3 major institutions in Los Angeles County. A total of 3486 Mohs micrographic surgeries of basal cell, squamous cell, and basosquamous cell carcinomas were analyzed.','Mohs micrographic surgery defect sizes were 17% larger among Hispanic/Latino patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. More notably, when comparing defect sizes of squamous cell carcinomas to those of basal cell carcinomas, defects were 80% larger among Hispanic/Latino patients compared to non-Hispanic White patients who had 25% larger defect sizes. Compared to patients with Medicare, patients with health maintenance organization and Medicaid/health maintenance organization had 22% and 52% larger defect sizes, respectively, whereas patients with preferred provider organization, had 10% smaller defect sizes.','The data included were from a single county population.','Disparities regarding nonmelanoma skin cancer exist between patients with skin of color and White patients. Patients and the medical community need to be cognizant that skin cancer can develop in patients regardless of their race and ethnicity."
"The use of telemedicine outpatient visits has increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. Although disparities in access to telemedicine by age and socioeconomic status (SES) have been well-documented, evidence is limited as to how these disparities changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the equity of patient access to telemedicine has been scarcely reported in Japan, despite the huge potential for telemedicine expansion.','We aimed to investigate changes due to age and SES disparities in telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.','Using data from a large internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan, we examined the associations of participant age and SES (educational attainment, urbanicity of residence, and income level) with their telemedicine use in the following two time periods during the pandemic: April 2020 and August-September 2020.','Of the 24,526 participants aged 18 to 79 years (50.8% [n=12,446] women), the proportion of individuals who reported using telemedicine increased from 2.0% (n=497) in April 2020 to 4.7% (n=1159) in August-September 2020. After adjusting for potential confounders, younger individuals were more likely to use telemedicine than older individuals in April 2020. Although this pattern persisted in August-September 2020, we also observed a substantial increase in telemedicine use among individuals aged 70 to 79 years (adjusted rates, 0.2% in April 2020 vs 3.8% in August-September 2020; P<.001 after multiple comparisons). We found disparities in telemedicine use by SES in August-September 2020 that did not exist in April 2020. In August-September 2020, individuals with a university degree were more likely to use telemedicine than those with a high school diploma or less (adjusted rates, 6.6% vs 3.5%; P<.001). Individuals living in urban areas exhibited higher rates of telemedicine use than those living in rural areas only in August-September 2020 (adjusted rates, 5.2% vs 3.8%; P<.001). Disparities in telemedicine use by income level were not observed in either time period.','In general, younger individuals increased their use of telemedicine compared to older individuals during the pandemic, although individuals in their 70s also increased their use of telemedicine. Disparities in telemedicine use by educational attainment and urbanicity of residence widened during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Disparities in cancer have been documented for decades and continue to persist despite clinical advancements in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. Disparate cancer outcomes continue to affect many populations in the United States and globally, including racial and ethnic minorities, populations with low income and education, and residents of rural areas or low socioeconomic neighborhoods, among others. Addressing cancer disparities requires approaches that are multilevel. Addressing social determinants of health, such as removing obstacles to health (e.g., poverty, discrimination, access to housing and education, jobs with fair pay, and health care) can reduce cancer disparities. However, to achieve cancer health equity, multilevel approaches are required to ensure that access to high-quality cancer care and equitable receipt of evidence-based services can reduce cancer disparities. Policy, health system interventions, and innovative delivery and health care coverage approaches by private and public payers, employer-based payers, and labor union organizations can assist in ensuring access to and receipt of high-quality cancer care while addressing the high costs of care delivery. Partnerships among patients, caregivers, employers, health care providers, and health care payers can make impactful changes in the way in which cancer care is delivered and, in turn, can assist in reducing cancer disparities."
"Healthcare systems use population health management programs to improve the quality of cardiovascular disease care. Adding a dedicated population health coordinator (PHC) who identifies and reaches out to patients not meeting cardiovascular care goals to these programs may help reduce disparities in cardiovascular care.','To determine whether a program that used PHCs decreased racial/ethnic disparities in LDL cholesterol and blood pressure (BP) control.','Retrospective difference-in-difference analysis.','Twelve thousdand five hundred fifty-five primary care patients with cardiovascular disease (cohort for LDL analysis) and 41,183 with hypertension (cohort for BP analysis).','From July 1, 2014-December 31, 2014, 18 practices used an information technology (IT) system to identify patients not meeting LDL and BP goals; 8 practices also received a PHC. We examined whether having the PHC plus IT system, compared with having the IT system alone, decreased racial/ethnic disparities, using difference-in-difference analysis of data collected before and after program implementation.','Meeting guideline concordant LDL and BP goals.','At baseline, there were racial/ethnic disparities in meeting LDL (p = 0.007) and BP (p = 0.0003) goals. Comparing practices with and without a PHC, and accounting for pre-intervention LDL control, non-Hispanic white patients in PHC practices had improved odds of LDL control (OR 1.20 95% CI 1.09-1.32) compared with those in non-PHC practices. Non-Hispanic black (OR 1.15 95% CI 0.80-1.65) and Hispanic (OR 1.29 95% CI 0.66-2.53) patients saw similar, but non-significant, improvements in LDL control. For BP control, non-Hispanic white patients in PHC practices (versus non-PHC) improved (OR 1.13 95% CI 1.05-1.22). Non-Hispanic black patients (OR 1.17 95% CI 0.94-1.45) saw similar, but non-statistically significant, improvements in BP control, but Hispanic (OR 0.90 95% CI 0.59-1.36) patients did not. Interaction testing confirmed that disparities did not decrease (p = 0.73 for LDL and p = 0.69 for BP).','The population health management intervention did not decrease disparities. Further efforts should explicitly target improving both healthcare equity and quality. Clinical Trials #: NCT02812303 ( ClinicalTrials.gov )."
"Substantial health disparities have been reported between Black and White Americans diagnosed with schizophrenia. The nature and extent of these disparities among individuals receiving services in an equal-access health care system remains understudied.','The purpose of this study was to examine disparities in enrollment characteristics, service delivery and clinical outcomes between Black and White veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia who received care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), an equal-access health care system.','National program evaluation data from the VHA Intensive Community Mental Health Recovery (ICMHR) program were used to evaluate disparities between 2436 Black and 3565 White veterans who enrolled between 1999 and 2013. Veterans and case managers completed measures of sociodemographic factors, clinical history, clinical characteristics, and justice system involvement at enrollment and six months. Chi square and ANOVAs were used to evaluate enrollment and service delivery differences. Six-month changes were evaluated using multiple regression controlling for potentially confounding baseline characteristics. Effect sizes were evaluated with Cohen's d.','Results indicated differences between Black and White veterans in clinical history, justice system involvement, and clinical characteristics at enrollment. Minimal differences in service delivery were noted and longitudinal analyses revealed no significant differences between Black and White veterans on the majority of outcomes.','Fewer racial disparities in service use and outcomes were observed in ICMHR than in standard non-VA clinic settings. This study demonstrates that disparities may emerge more strongly from systemic rather than individual-level differences."
"Prostate cancer remains the leading diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death among American men. Despite improvements in screening modalities, diagnostics, and treatment, disparities exist among Black men in this country. The primary objective of this systematic review is to describe the reported disparities in screening, diagnostics, and treatments as well as efforts to alleviate these disparities through community and educational outreach efforts. Critical review took place of retrospective, prospective, and socially descriptive data of English language publications in the PubMed database. Despite more advanced presentation, lower rates of screening and diagnostic procedures, and low rates of trial inclusion, subanalyses have shown that various modalities of therapy are quite effective in Black populations. Moreover, patients treated on prospective clinical trials and within equal-access care environments have shown similar outcomes regardless of race. Additional prospective studies and enhanced participation in screening, diagnostic and genetic testing, clinical trials, and community-based educational endeavors are important to ensure equitable progress in prostate cancer for all patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Notable progress has been made with therapeutic advances for prostate cancer, but racial disparities continue to exist. Differing rates in screening and utility in diagnostic procedures play a role in these disparities. Black patients often present with more advanced disease, higher prostate-specific antigen, and other adverse factors, but outcomes can be attenuated in trials or in equal-access care environments. Recent data have shown that multiple modalities of therapy are quite effective in Black populations. Novel and bold hypotheses to increase inclusion in clinical trial, enhance decentralized trial efforts, and enact successful models of patient navigation and community partnership are vital to ensure continued progress in prostate cancer disparities."
"Health literacy has been identified as a contributor to both health disparities and social determinants of health. There is significant overlap in demographic characteristics of those who are at risk for health disparities and low health literacy. This study expanded the research on health literacy and disparities by quantifying the social disparities within health literacy using a relatively new methodology. We analyzed data from the 2013 Health Information National Trends Survey (<i>N</i> = 1,675). The Extended Gastwirth Index was used to determine the disparities in health literacy. Participants who were female, age 18 to 34 years, White, highly educated (postbaccalaureate), and with incomes ≥$200,000 had the highest health literacy and served as the reference groups. Males, age 35 to 49 years, who had high school graduates, and people who were Hispanic and with incomes between $50,000 and $74,999 had the highest disparities in health literacy. Income (∼30%) and education (∼37%) were the highest contributors to overall disparities in health literacy, whereas sex (∼3%) was the lowest contributor. The overwhelming contribution of income and education to disparities in health literacy and the range of disparities within these demographic characteristics highlight populations that could benefit from tailored interventions to improve their health literacy. <b>[<i>HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice</i>. 2019;3(1):e47-e52.]</b>."
"Health disparities and health inequities can lead to poor health outcomes. However, health disparities continue to persist in communities across the United States, presenting a crucial public health challenge. Persisting budget cuts and workforce challenges tend to hinder local health departments' (LHDs') ability to assess and address health disparities.','To examine the extent to which LHDs' use of informatics effects their engagement in strategies and activities addressing health disparities.','Data from the 2016 Profile of LHDs were used in examining the association of informatics with 9 activities addressing health disparities/inequities.','Fifty-nine percent of LHDs used data and described health disparities in their jurisdiction, and 12% conducted original research to link health disparities to differences in social or environmental conditions. Less than 40% of LHDs prioritized resources for the reduction of health disparities. LHDs that implemented information systems had increased odds of describing the disparities in their jurisdiction (P < .01) and having prioritized resources for the reduction of disparities (P < .01). Per capita expenditures, participation in a national accreditation program process, and a larger LHD population were also positively associated with 7 of 9 activities for addressing health disparities/inequities.','As LHDs advance efforts to reduce health disparities and inequities, leadership will find informatics a useful strategy. National initiatives aimed to boost LHDs' engagement in the reduction of disparities might benefit from our findings, positing a positive influence of informatics."
"While young adults are generally at highest risk for alcohol problems, not all age out of problem drinking. Evidence suggests that Blacks and Latinos age out more slowly than Whites, particularly among men. Targeting men, we investigated whether differences in lifecourse SES might explain racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol dependence in late young adulthood, along with how experiencing alcohol dependence at that life stage relates to subsequent SES.','We used longitudinal, national data to (i) describe racial/ethnic disparities in late young adult alcohol dependence criteria (LYADC), (ii) examine whether income trajectory in early young adulthood contributes to these racial/ethnic disparities, and (iii) test whether LYADC reciprocally predicts income trajectory in early midlife. Data were from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (N = 3,993), which measured LYADC in 1994 (mean age = 33). Income trajectory classes were derived for early young adulthood (mean ages = 21 to 31) and, separately, early midlife (mean ages = 35 to 45). Analyses included negative binomial regressions and multinomial regressions.','Both Black and US-born Latino men reported more LYADC than White men. Further, membership in the persistently low and slow increase (vs. stable middle) early young adult income trajectory classes was associated with more LYADC. Multivariate analyses suggested that Black-White disparities in LYADC were explained by early young adult income trajectories, whereas Latino-White disparities in the same were explained by both early young adult income trajectories and early education. In controlled models, more LYADC predicted a higher likelihood of membership in the persistently low (vs. stable middle) income trajectory class in early midlife.','This study found that poorer SES in early adulthood contributes to alcohol dependence, which reciprocally contributes to poorer SES in early midlife. This cycle appears particularly likely to affect Black and US-born Latino men. Results underline the need to address socioeconomic factors in addressing racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol problems."
"The aim of this study was to investigate disparities in time between breast biopsy recommendation and completion and the impact of a same-day biopsy (SDB) program for patients with serious mental illness (SMI), with a focus on more vulnerable individuals with public payer insurance.','In August 2017, the authors' academic breast imaging center started routinely offering needle biopsies on the day of recommendation. Primary outcomes were the proportion of biopsies performed as SDBs and days from biopsy recommendation to completion over a 2.5-year pre- versus postintervention period, comparing all patients with SMI versus those without, and public payer-insured patients <65 years of age with SMI (SMI-PP) versus without SMI (non-SMI-PP). Multivariable proportional odds and logistic regression models were fit to assess association of SMI status, age, race/ethnicity, language, and insurance with days to biopsy and SDB within each period.','There were 2,026 biopsies preintervention and 2,361 biopsies postintervention. Preintervention, 8.43% of patients with SMI (7 of 83) underwent SDB compared with 15.59% of those without SMI (303 of 1,943) (P = .076), and 2.7% of the SMI-PP subgroup (1 of 37) underwent SDB compared with 15.88% of the non-SMI-PP subgroup (47 of 296) (P = .031). Adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and language, disparities persisted in odds for undergoing SDB (adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.92; P = .04) and having longer days to biopsy (adjusted odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-4.37; P = .01) for the SMI-PP subgroup compared with the non-SMI-PP subgroup in the preintervention period. There was no evidence of these disparities postintervention for the SMI-PP subgroup. SDB proportion increased from 15.3% (310 of 2,026) to 36.09% (852 of 2,361) (P < .001) across all patients.','A same-day breast biopsy program mitigates disparities in time to biopsy for patients with SMI and helps improve breast cancer care equity for this vulnerable population."
"Persistent race disparities in advance care planning (ACP) are troubling, given Black and Hispanic older adults' elevated risk of disease, some dementias, and receipt of care that may not align with their preferences. A potentially important yet underexplored explanation for these disparities is subjective life expectancy (SLE), or beliefs about one's future survival which may impel or impede ACP.','Data are from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; n=8,912). We examined the extent to which perceived chances of living another 10 years are associated with three components of ACP (living will, durable power of attorney for health care [DPAHC], and informal discussions). We used multilevel logistic regression models to evaluate the extent to which SLE mediates the association between race and ACP, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health characteristics.','Black and Hispanic older adults have significantly lower rates of ACP relative to whites. These disparities persist even when SLE is controlled. Blacks report especially optimistic whereas Hispanics report pessimistic survival expectations, although these differences do not explain racial disparities in ACP. SLE has direct effects on ACP, such that persons who report an ""uncertain"" SLE are less likely to have a living will or a DPAHC, whereas those who perceive a 50 percent chance of survival have significantly greater odds of discussions, relative to those who perceive a 0 percent chance of survival.','Doctor-patient conversations about the likely course of one's illness may inform patients' knowledge of their SLE, which may motivate timely ACP."
"Hispanic women have lower rates of use of infertility services than non-Hispanic White women. There are many barriers that impede access to infertility care including economic, geographic, cultural, and societal factors and there are disparities in treatment outcomes. Hispanic women are less likely to seek infertility care than non-Hispanic White women and even after infertility evaluation, Hispanic women are less likely to receive treatment for their infertility. Lower use of infertility treatments among Hispanic women is unlikely to be driven solely by economic factors. There is disappointingly little data on in-vitro fertilization treatment outcomes including the population of Hispanic women, and existing data has yielded conflicting results. Incomplete and variable reporting of race data across clinics raises the potential for misclassification bias and invalid study conclusions. Addressing disparities in access to reproductive medicine in the Hispanic population will required a multifaceted approach including expanded insurance coverage, improved education for both patients and providers, and additional research on barriers to care."
"COVID-19 morbidity and mortality has disproportionately affected vulnerable populations such as minority racial/ethnic groups. Understanding disparities in vaccine intentions and reasons for vaccine hesitancy are important for developing effective strategies for ameliorating racial/ethnic COVID-19 inequities.','Using six waves of the large, nationally representative Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey data from January 6-March 29, 2021 (n = 459,235), we examined national and state estimates for vaccination intent, defined as receipt of ≥ 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or definite intent to be vaccinated, by race/ethnicity with stratification by household income and age group. In separate logistic regression models, we also examined the interaction between race/ethnicity and household income, and race/ethnicity and age group, and its association with vaccination intent. Lastly, we examined reasons for not vaccinating by race/ethnicity.','Vaccination intent differed by racial/ethnic group, household income, and age group nationally and by Health and Human Services (HHS) region and state. A significant interaction was observed between race/ethnicity and household income (F(8,72) = 4.50, p < 0.001), and race/ethnicity and age group (F(8,72) = 15.66, p < 0.001). Non-Hispanic Black adults with lower income (<$35,000) and younger age (18-49 years) were least likely to intend to vaccinate. Similar disparities across racial/ethnic groups were seen across most HHS regions and states. Concerns about possible side effects and effectiveness were significantly higher among all minority groups compared to non-Hispanic White adults.','Disparities in vaccination intent by racial/ethnic groups underscore the need for interventions and recommendations designed to improve vaccination coverage and confidence in underserved communities, such as younger and lower income racial/ethnic minority groups. Efforts to reduce disparities and barriers to vaccination are needed to achieve equity in vaccination coverage, and ultimately, to curb COVID-19 transmission."
"Racial disparities are a major issue in health care but the overall extent of the issue in spinal surgery outcomes is unclear. We conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis of disparities in outcomes among patients belonging to different racial groups who had undergone surgery for degenerative spine disease.','We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Review Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 20, 2021 for relevant articles assessing outcomes after spine surgery stratified by race. We included studies that compared outcomes after spine surgery for degenerative disease among different racial groups.','We found 30 studies that met our inclusion criteria (28 articles and 2 published abstracts). We included data from 20 cohort studies in our meta-analysis (3,501,830 patients), which were assessed to have a high risk of observation/selection bias. Black patients had a 55% higher risk of dying after spine surgery compared with white patients (relative risk [RR], 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.87; I<sup>2</sup> = 70%). Similarly, black patients had a longer length of stay (mean difference, 0.93 days; 95% CI, 0.75-1.10; I<sup>2</sup> = 73%), and higher risk of nonhome discharge (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.47-1.81; I<sup>2</sup> = 89%), and 30-day readmission (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03-2.04; I<sup>2</sup> = 96%). No significant difference was noted in the pooled analyses for complication or reoperation rates.','Black patients have a significantly higher risk of unfavorable outcomes after spine surgery compared with white patients.

"Despite increases in BRCA mutation testing, racial/ethnic disparities in counseling and testing have persisted for decades. The purpose of the review was to summarize recent literature as it relates to detecting, understanding, and reducing disparities in BRCA counseling and testing.','This is a narrative review of articles published January 2012 to July 2017 relevant to genetic testing and counseling, breast and ovarian cancer, and minority health and heath disparities. Twenty-three articles were included in this review.','Studies report lower counseling and/or testing rates for eligible racial/ethnic minorities among family members of high-risk individuals as well as among breast cancer survivors. Key barriers and facilitators of disparate BRCA counseling/testing that emerged in this review included awareness, cost-related factors, stress and distrust, family concerns and communication, and provider communication and referral. To address differential access to and use of BRCA testing services and expand testing in minority populations, it is necessary for interventions to focus on improving awareness, risk-perception, and family and patient-provider communication.','Multi-level and targeted interventions are needed to reduce persistent racial/ethnic disparities and improve assessment, provider recommendations, counseling and testing among minority populations."
"This paper estimates the benefits of eliminating racial disparities in mortality rates and work weeks lost due to illness. Using data from the American Community Survey (2005⁻2007) and Minnesota vital statistics (2011⁻2015), we explore economic methodologies for estimating the costs of health disparities. The data reveal large racial disparities in both mortality and labor market non-participation arising from preventable diseases and illnesses. Estimates show that if racial disparities in preventable deaths were eliminated, the annualized number of lives saved ranges from 475 to 812, which translates into $1.2 billion to $2.9 billion per year in economic savings (in 2017 medical care inflation-adjusted dollars). After eliminating the unexplained racial disparities in labor market participation, an additional 4,217 to 9185 Minnesota residents would have worked each year, which equals $247.43 million to $538.85 million in yearly net benefits to Minnesota."
"Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer among both men and women in the United States. We aimed to determine racial and socioeconomic disparities in emergent colectomy rates for colorectal cancer in the US Health Care system.','We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample including adult patients (⩾18 years) diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and who underwent colorectal resection while admitted between 2008 and 2015. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to assess the association between emergent admissions, compared to elective admissions, and postoperative outcomes.','A total of 141,641 hospitalizations were included: 93,775 (66%) were elective admissions and 47,866 (34%) were emergent admissions. Black patients were more likely to undergo emergent colectomy, compared to white patients (42% vs 32%, p < 0.0001). Medicaid and Medicare patients were also more likely to have an emergent colectomy, compared to private insurance (47% and 36% vs 25%, respectively, p < 0.0001), as were patients with low household income, compared to highest (38% vs 31%, p < 0.0001). Emergent procedures were less likely to be laparoscopic (19% vs 38%, p < 0.0001). Patients undergoing emergent colectomy were significantly more likely to have postoperative venous thromboembolism, wound complications, infection, bleeding, cardiac failure, renal failure, respiratory failure, shock, and inpatient mortality.','There are significant racial and socioeconomic disparities in emergent colectomy rates for colorectal cancer. Efforts to reduce this disparity in colorectal cancer surgery patients should be prioritized to improve outcomes."
"<b>Background:</b> The finance of health professional education (HPE) is of immense importance for effective and sustainable health systems, yet relevant empirical research was scarce due to the lack of financial data. The study aimed to bridge the gap by presenting the scenario of finance for health professional institutions (HPIs) of different tiers in China and exploring how the stratification of institutions affected their funding disparities. <b>Methods:</b> The study employed data collected from the Ministry of Education in China, and selected the HPIs mainly based on the World Directory of Medical Schools. The funding levels and disparities of China's HPIs during the period (1998-2017) were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and the indicators of funding per institution and funding per student were both considered. The average funding in HPIs was presented by tiers, and the Gini coefficient and Theil index were employed to describe the differences in financing among HPIs over the span. <b>Results:</b> The study found that the number of HPIs has kept growing over the past two decades, with both the funding per institution and the funding per student increasing steadily. Specifically, the average funding per institution of the three tiers increased by 31.5 times, 13.4 times, and 10.5 times separately, with the first-tier universities having an absolute advantage compared to lower tiers. As for the financing disparities among HPIs, the Gini coefficient of the funding per institution maintained to be over 0.5, with the third-tier institutions scoring the highest, while the Gini coefficient of the funding per student all ranged approximately from 0.2 to 0.3. Through the decomposition of the inequalities measured by the Theil index, the share of the between-tier difference in per-institution funding grew from 29.7 in 1998 to 77.9% in 2017. <b>Conclusions:</b> The funding disparities between tiers of HPIs in China gradually became more accentuated, with the top-tier institutions taking up the largest share. Although the stratified development in HPE has posed a challenge to the unified quality assurance of medical personnel training, it may also be regarded as an effective pathway for developing countries like China to achieve stable development in health professional education."
"Although Black Americans are not substantially more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19, hospitalization rates and death rates are considerably higher than for White Americans. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between systemic racism generally, and residential segregation in particular, and racial/ethnic disparities in deaths due to COVID-19.','To assess racial disparities in COVID-19 and systemic racism in US states, we calculated descriptive statistics and bivariate Pearson correlations. Using data on deaths through December 2020, we developed a weighted logistic mixed model to assess whether state-level systemic racism generally and residential segregation, in particular, predicted the probability of COVID-19 deaths among Americans, considering key sociodemographic factors.','Residential segregation is a stronger predictor of COVID-19 deaths among Black Americans, as compared to systemic racism more generally. Looking at the interaction between residential segregation and COVID-19 death rates by race, residential segregation is associated with negative outcomes for Black and White Americans, but disproportionately impacts Black state residents (P<.001), who have 2.14 times higher odds of dying from COVID-19 when residential segregation is increased.','To understand and address disparities in infectious disease, researchers and public health practitioners should acknowledge how different forms of systemic racism shape health outcomes in the United States. More attention should be given to the mechanisms by which infectious disease pandemics exacerbate health disparities in areas of high residential segregation and should inform more targeted health policies. Such policy changes stand to make all American communities more resilient in the face of new and emerging infectious diseases."
"Although evidence suggests worse breast cancer-specific survival associated with treatment delay beyond 90 days, little is known regarding the sociodemographic predictors of delays in cancer-directed surgery among young women with breast cancer. This is particularly notable, given that 5-10% of new diagnoses occur in younger women aged <40 years, commonly with more aggressive features than in older women.','We used the National Cancer Database (2004-2017) to assess sociodemographic disparities in delay of upfront surgery beyond 90 days among young women with non-metastatic breast cancer, using multivariable logistic regression and predictive marginal modeling.','Black women experienced treatment delays more frequently than white women (aOR: 1.93 [95% CI: 1.76-2.11], p < 0.001). Adjusted rates of treatment delay were 4.91% [95% CI: 4.51%-5.30%] and 2.60% [95% CI: 2.47%-2.74%] for Black and white women, respectively, and 2.97% [95% CI: 2.83%-3.12%], 2.36% [95% CI: 2.03%-2.68%], and 1.18% [95% CI: 0.54%-1.81%] for women from metro, urban, and rural areas, respectively.','These results suggest that improving access to timely treatment may be leveraged as a means through which to lessen the breast cancer disparities experienced by Black women."
"Subjec tive social status (SSS) has consistently been linked to health outcomes among Latinx populations, but less is known about how discrimination explains the relationship between SSS and health disparities. While SSS, an individual's perception of her socioeconomic standing, is a robust predictor of health disparities in many societies, discriminatory experiences may impact the relationship between SSS and mental health and health outcomes. Subjective social status can negatively contribute to health disparities through several pathways including the stigma associated with lower social status and poverty. Experiencing discrimination can contribute to feelings of marginalization and therefore decrease individuals' perception of their social status. This study tested discrimination as a mediator of SSS and health disparities among Latinx populations.','Using the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), we identified 2554 Latinx participants to be included in the sample. Participants reported ratings of mental and physical health and exposure to everyday discrimination. Mediation models were used to analyze everyday discrimination as a mediator of SSS and health outcomes.','The present results support that SSS is directly associated with ratings of mental and physical health in Latinx individuals. Discrimination was also found to mediate the relationship between SSS and health outcomes.','These findings have practice implications for health disparities among Latinx populations. In particular, discrimination may be a major contributing factor to the role of SSS on health outcomes."
"Insomnia has been on the rise during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which may disproportionately affect racial minorities. This study characterized racial disparities in insomnia during the pandemic and evaluated mechanisms for such disparities.','Participants included 196 adults (48 Black) from a 2016-2017 clinical trial of insomnia treatment who were reevaluated in April 2020. Race was evaluated as a predictor of change in insomnia, impact of COVID-19, and COVID-19 stress. Mediation models using the PRODCLIN method evaluated the extent to which: (1) COVID-19 impact accounted for Black-White disparities in change in insomnia, and (2) COVID-19 stress accounted for associations between discrimination and change in insomnia.','Increases in insomnia symptoms during COVID-19 were greater in Black compared to White participants, with 4.3 times the odds of severe insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index ≥ 22). Symptom severity was associated with pre-pandemic experiences of discrimination. Black participants were also disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, with twice the odds of irreparable loss of income/employment and four times the rate of COVID-19 diagnoses in their sociofamilial network compared to White participants. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 accounted for 69.2% of the relationship between race and change in insomnia severity, and COVID-19 related stress accounted for 66.5% of the relationship between prior history of racial discrimination and change in insomnia severity.','Black-White disparities in insomnia severity during COVID-19 may be driven by structural inequities resulting in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Americans. Results lend support for the minority stress model in the context of sleep health.','Sleep to Prevent Evolving Affecting Disorders (SPREAD).

"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> This study aimed to investigate mortality disparities for sexual minority adults in the United States. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We used data from 26,384 adult respondents using the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, linked with National Death Index mortality files. Respondents reporting one or more same-sex sexual partners in their lifetime or who identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual were considered sexual minority adults (617 sexual minority males and 963 sexual minority females). We examined gender-stratified mortality frequencies by sexual minority status and used gender-stratified Cox proportional hazard models to investigate mortality risk for sexual minority adults compared with non-sexual-minority adults. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We observed significantly elevated mortality risk among sexual minority females compared with non-sexual-minority females, robust across model specifications. Estimates ranged from an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-3.2) to 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4-3.3) among sexual minority females compared with non-sexual-minority females, with estimates at approximately double the risk of mortality. We found no evidence of differential mortality risk for sexual minority males compared with non-sexual-minority males. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> These results suggest mortality disparities for sexual minority females compared with non-sexual-minority females. Future research should consider mortality disparities among subgroups of sexual minority adults and include targeted data collection to increase understanding of the mechanisms behind mortality disparities."
"<b>Objectives:</b> We investigate whether obesity accounts for widening socioeconomic disparities in pain. <b>Methods:</b> Based on nationally representative samples of Americans aged 25-74 in 1995-1996 and 2011-2014, we use logistic regression to model period change in headaches, backaches, and joint aches as well as physical limitations and to determine whether those changes vary by a multidimensional measure of socioeconomic status. <b>Results:</b> Prevalence of backaches, joint aches, physical limitations, and obesity increased between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, particularly among more disadvantaged Americans. Socioeconomic disparities in frequent backaches, frequent joint pain, and physical limitations more than doubled over this period. We estimate that obesity and health conditions may account for nearly a quarter of the widening disparity in frequent backaches and about half of the widening disparity in frequent joint pain and physical limitations. <b>Discussion:</b> Widening disparities in backaches, joint pain, and physical limitations have coincided with growing obesity."
"Disparities in the experience of chronic musculoskeletal pain in the United States stem from a confluence of a broad array of factors. Organized within the National Institute on Aging Health Disparity Research Framework, a literature review was completed to evaluate what is known and what is needed to move chronic musculoskeletal pain research forward specific to disproportionately affected populations. Peer-reviewed studies published in English, on human adults, from 2000 to 2019, and conducted in the United States were extracted from PubMed and Web of Science. Articles were reviewed for key words that focused on underrepresented ethnic/race groups with chronic musculoskeletal pain applying health factor terms identified in the NIAHealth Disparity Research Framework four levels of analysis: 1) environmental, 2) sociocultural, 3) behavioral, and 4) biological. A total of 52 articles met inclusion criteria. There were limited publications specific to underrepresented ethnic/race groups with chronic musculoskeletal pain across all levels with particular research gaps under sociocultural and biological categories. Current limitations in evidence may be supplemented by a foundation of findings specific to the broader topic of ""chronic pain"" which provides guidance for future investigations. Study designs including a focus on protective factors and multiple levels of analyses would be particularly meritorious. PERSPECTIVE: Chronic musculoskeletal pain unequally burdens underrepresented ethnic/race groups. In order to move research forward and to systematically investigate the complex array of factors contributing toward health disparities, an organized approach is necessary. Applying the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework, an overview of the current state of evidence specific to chronic musculoskeletal pain and underrepresented ethnic/race groups is provided with future directions identified."
"The burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is high in rural America. Few studies, however, have examined urban/rural differences in health care access, or racial/ethnic and income disparities stratified by urban/rural residence, among persons with COPD.','We studied individuals age ≥ 40 years with COPD from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The primary exposure was ""urban"" or ""rural"" county of residence. We examined multiple health and health care access/services outcomes using logistic regressions adjusted for age and sex, and performed analyses stratified by rural/urban county that included additional adjustment for race/ethnicity or income.','Our sample included 34,439 individuals. COPD prevalence was 8.6% in rural counties versus 5.4% in urban counties. Rural residents with COPD were poorer, had less education, worse health, and more disability. Of the rural population with COPD, 12.6% were uninsured, versus 10.4% in urban areas (AOR 1.26; 95% CI: 1.00-1.58). Rural residents with COPD were more likely to have not seen a doctor due to cost (AOR 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02-1.36). Differences in other outcomes were mostly nonsignificant. We observed large access disparities by race/ethnicity and income among individuals in both urban and rural counties, with the highest rates of forgone care among minorities in rural counties.','Patients with COPD in rural areas experience greater morbidity and obstacles to care than those in urban areas. Racial/ethnic minorities and those with low incomes-particularly in rural areas-are also at greater risk of forgoing doctor visits due to cost. Expanded access to health care could address respiratory health inequities."
"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> We propose a new theoretically grounded approach for estimating sexual orientation-related health risk that accounts for the unique and shared variance of sexual identity across other measures of sexual orientation (i.e., attraction and behavior). We argue and illustrate that this approach provides specificity not demonstrated by approaches that independently estimate and compare health risk based on sexual identity, attraction, and behavior. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III, collected in 2012-2013 (<i>N</i> = 36,309, ages 18 and older). The Karlson-Holm-Breen method tested the degree to which attraction- and behavior-based disparities in mental health and substance use disorders change after adjusting for sexual identity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Sexual attraction- and behavior-based disparities in mental health and substance use disorders statistically varied when comparing models that did and did not adjust for sexual identity. Adjusting for sexual identity appeared to have a larger influence on attraction- and behavior-based health associations among men; sexual minority and majority differences were attenuated on nearly every outcome after adjusting for sexual identity. This attenuation was less common among women. Among women, some behavior-based disparities were wider in sexual identity-adjusted models relative to unadjusted models. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> We demonstrate more accurate approaches to capturing and comparing sexual orientation-related health disparities across multiple measures of sexual orientation, which account for the shared variance between sexual identity and measures of attraction and behavior. Adjusted estimates provide more specificity regarding relative health risk across specific subgroups of sexual minority people, and the intervention and prevention strategies needed to address them."
"Despite major advances in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] treatment, poorer overall survival (OS) persists for Black children with ALL compared with White children with ALL. The purpose of this literature review was to examine the racial disparities on OS in Black versus White children with ALL. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, PubMed, and Academic Search Complete databases were searched using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms: survival or mortality or outcome AND black or African-American or AA or minority AND racial disparities or race or racial/ethnic disparities AND cancer in children or pediatric cancer or children with leukemia or children with ALL for articles published in English between January 2009 and July 2019. Exclusion criteria were non-research articles, systematic reviews, conference abstracts, editorials, commentaries, correspondence, and case reports. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, data were extracted, appraised, and synthesized. Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Sample sizes across studies ranged from 184 to 31,866 participants. The factors most associated with disparities in OS included: age at diagnosis (e.g., <1 year and/or >10 years old), differences in clinical prognosticators (e.g., white blood cell count at diagnosis, T-cell vs. precursor B-cell immunophenotype, central nervous system disease status, cytogenetic profile) and lower socioeconomic status. Future prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of these factors in OS of Black children with ALL."
"The association between health outcomes and socioeconomic status (SES) has been widely documented, and mortality due to unintentional injuries continues to rank among the leading causes of death among British Columbians. This paper quantified the SES-related disparities in the mortality burden of three British Columbia's provincial injury prevention priority areas: falls among seniors, transport injury, and youth suicide.','Mortality data (2009 to 2013) from Vital Statistics and dissemination area or local health area level socioeconomic data from CensusPlus 2011 were linked to examine age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and disparities in ASMRs of unintentional injuries and subtypes including falls among seniors (aged 65+) and transport-related injuries as well as the intentional injury type of youth suicide (aged 15 to 24). Disparities by sex and geography were examined, and relative and absolute disparities were calculated between the least and most privileged areas based on income, education, employment, material deprivation, and social deprivation quintiles.','Our study highlighted significant sex differences in the mortality burden of falls among seniors, transport injury, and youth suicide with males experiencing significantly higher mortality rates. Notable geographic variations in overall unintentional injury ASMR were also observed across the province. In general, people living in areas with lower income and higher levels of material deprivation had increasingly higher mortality rates compared to their counterparts living in more privileged areas.','The significant differences in unintentional and intentional injury-related mortality outcomes between the sexes and by SES present opportunities for targeted prevention strategies that address the disparities."
"Underweight is one of the largest contributors to child morbidity and mortality and is considered to be the largest contributor to the global burden of diseases in low-and middle-income countries. In Mauritania, where one-fifth of children are underweight, there is a dearth of evidence on socio-economic, sex and geographic disparities in childhood underweight. As a result, this study aimed at investigating the socio-economic, sex and geographic disparities in childhood underweight in Mauritania.','Using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the Mauritania Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICSs) conducted between 2007 and 2015 were analysed. Childhood underweight was disaggregated by five equity stratifiers: education, wealth, residence, region and sex. In addition, absolute and relative inequality measures, namely difference (D), population attributable risk (PAR), ratio (R) and population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated to understand inequalities from wider perspectives. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to measure statistical significance.','Substantial absolute and relative socio-economic, sex and geographic disparities in underweight were observed from 2007 to 2015. Children from the poorest households (PAR=-12.66 [95% CI -14.15 to -11.16]), those whose mothers were uneducated (PAF=-9.11 [95% CI -13.41 to -4.81]), those whose mothers were rural residents (R=1.52 [95% CI 1.37 to 1.68]), residents of HodhCharghy (PAF=-66.51 [95% CI -79.25 to -53.76]) and males (D=4.30 [95% CI 2.09 to 6.52]) experienced a higher burden of underweight. Education-related disparities decreased from 2007 to 2015. The urban-rural gap in underweight similarly decreased over time with the different measures showing slightly different reductions. Wealth-driven disparities decreased marginally from 2011 to 2015. The sex-based and regional disparities increased, at least on average, over the 8-y intersurvey period.','The burden of underweight was significantly higher among children from disadvantaged subpopulations, those with uneducated and poorest/poor mothers, those living in rural areas and those living in HodhCharghy. Special nutrition intervention and efforts focused on these deprived subpopulations are required to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality associated with underweight and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals."
"Incisional hernias represent an acquired defect from failed healing of an abdominal facial incision and are therefore distinct from primary hernias. While literature regarding incisional hernia incidence, risk factors, and treatment are abundant, no study has examined national health disparities specific to incisional hernia repair. The objective of this study was to analyze national health disparities unique to surgical incisional hernia repair procedures.','Patient data queried from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample from 2012 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases 9th revision procedure codes for incisional hernia repair were used to generate univariate and multivariate models including demographics, socioeconomic factors, admission status, and hospital characteristics. Primary outcomes were nonelective admission status, in-hospital mortality, surgical complications, and extended duration of stay.','We estimated that 89,258 incisional hernia repair procedures occurred annually from 2012 to 2014, incurring $6.3 billion in hospital charges. By multivariate analysis, multiple risk factors contribute to significantly increased odds of nonelective repair. These include age over 65, female sex, non-White race, nonprivate insurance, obesity, and increased Charlson comorbidity index. Nonelective incisional hernia repair was strongly correlated with worse outcomes including in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 3.01 [2.51, 3.61]), postoperative complications (odds ratio 1.2 [1.14, 1.25]), and extended duration of stay (odds ratio 2.96 [2.81, 3.12]). After controlling for admission status, other disparities persisted including extended duration of stay for Black individuals (odds ratio 1.21 (1.12, 1.31]).','Providers should be aware of these significant health disparities in incisional hernia repair status and outcomes especially for elderly, non-White, nonprivate insurance, and obese/comorbid patients. Management strategies that increase access to elective repair and that prevent incisional hernia should be expanded to address these disparities."
"Cardiovascular health (CVH) is associated with reductions in age-related disease and later-life mortality. Black adults, particularly Black women, are less likely to achieve ideal CVH. Guided by intersectionality and life-course approaches, we examine to what degree (a) disparities in CVH exist at the intersection of race and gender and (b) CVH disparities would be reduced if marginalized groups had the same levels of resources and adversities as privileged groups.','We used biomarker subsamples from the Midlife in the United States Core and Refresher studies (N = 1,948). Causal decomposition analysis was implemented to test hypothetical interventions to equalize the distribution of early-life adversities (ELAs), perceived discrimination, or midlife socioeconomic status (SES) between marginalized and privileged groups. We conducted sensitivity analyses to determine to what degree unmeasured confounders would invalidate our findings.','White women have the highest CVH score, followed by White men, Black men, and Black women. Intervening on ELAs would reduce the disparities: White men versus Black women (30% reduction) and White women versus Black women (15%). Intervening on perceived discrimination would not substantially change initial disparities. Intervening on midlife SES would yield large disparity reductions: White men versus Black men (64%), White men versus Black women (60%), and White women versus Black women (27%). These reductions are robust to unmeasured confounders.','Providing economic security in adulthood for Blacks may help reduce racial disparities in CVH. Preventing exposure to ELAs among Black women may reduce their vulnerability to cardiovascular disease, compared to White adults."
"We determined whether there were disparities in the likelihood of being diagnosed at a late stage for breast cancer (BC) or colorectal cancer (CRC) in each of 40 states, using the recently available US Cancer Statistics (USCS) database.','We extracted 981,457 BC cases and 558,568 CRC cases diagnosed in 2004-2009. Separate multilevel regressions were run for each state and each cancer type. Models included person and area-level covariates and were identically specified across states. The disparities foci were race or ethnicity (white, African-American, Hispanic, Asian, all other), gender, and age (<40, 40-49, 50-64, 65-74, and 75+). Using whites, males, and the oldest age group as reference groups, we noted the statistically significant disparities coefficients (p value ≤0.05) and translated the findings via a set of maps of states in the USA.','National disparity estimates were not consistent with disparities identified in the states. Some states had estimates consistent with the national average, while others did not. Patterns of disparities across states were different for each covariate and mapped separately.','National disparity estimates may mask what is true at the more local, state level because national estimates can confound the effects of race with place. Cancer control efforts are local and require locally relevant information to assess needs. Findings from the period 2004-2009 establish valuable benchmarks against which to assess changes following national health reform implemented in 2010. The USCS database is a valuable new resource that will facilitate future disparities research."
"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) represent a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Racial/ethnic disparities have been documented in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, but health disparities have not been well described in patients with PNETs.','A retrospective review of patients with PNETs in the National Cancer Database was performed for 2004-2014. Approximately 16 605 patients with PNETs and available vital status were identified. Survival was compared by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression.','There were no significant differences in survival between Non-Hispanic, White; Hispanic, White; or Non-Hispanic, Black patients on univariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients from communities with lower median household income and education level had worse survival (p < 0.001). Patients age less than 65 without insurance, similarly, had worse survival (p < 0.001). Multivariable modeling found no association between race/ethnicity and risk of mortality (p = 0.37). Lower median household income and lower education level were associated with increased mortality (p < 0.001).','Unlike most other malignancies, race/ethnicity is not associated with survival differences in patients with PNETs. Patients with lower socioeconomic status had worse survival. The presence of identifiable health disparities in patients with PNETs represents a target for intervention and opportunity to improve survival in patients with this malignancy."
"Female authors are underrepresented in cardiology journals, although prior work suggested improvement in reducing disparities over time. Early in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, female authorship continued to lag that of their male counterparts despite a surge in publications. The cumulative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on authorship gender disparities remains unclear. We aimed to characterize gender disparities in COVID-19-related cardiology publications across the duration of the ongoing pandemic.','We retrospectively analyzed COVID-19-related research articles published in the top 20 impact factor cardiology journals between March and June 2021. Gender representation data were extracted for any author, first authors, and senior authors.','We found that 841 articles were related to COVID-19, with a total of 5586 authors and an average of 42 articles per journal. Less than a third (29.9%) of the total authors from publications were women. Women represented a smaller proportion of first authors (21.3%) and senior authors (16.4%).','Female authorship has continued to lag male authorship for the duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic may have impeded progress in reducing gender disparities in academic cardiology publications. The low proportions of first and senior female authors may reflect the impact of the pandemic on women in cardiology in leadership domains."
"This review is an assessment of the state of the science on nutrition disparities and their contribution to disparities in cardiovascular health.','Nutrition disparities remain pervasive by race/ethnicity, sex/gender, socioeconomic status, and geography. They are rooted in differences in social, cultural, and environmental determinants of health, behavioral and lifestyle factors, and the impact of policy interventions. Systematic differences in diet quality, dietary patterns, and nutrient intakes contribute to cardiovascular disparities and are mediated by microbiota, and CVD risk factors including high levels of blood pressure, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and glucose; oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial dysfunction. Despite the progress made in nutrition research, important gaps persist that signal the need for more effective interventions at multiple levels to reduce cardiovascular disparities. Research opportunities include (1) exploring the gene-nutrient-environment interactions in the context of ancestral diversity; (2) investigating the causal link between diet and gut microbiota and impact of social determinants of health; (3) understanding resilience; (4) testing the effectiveness of multi-level interventions that address social and environmental determinants; and (4) supporting intervention research informed by validated implementation science frameworks."
"The extent to which disparities affect all sexual minority women (SMW) versus specific subgroups of lesbian, bisexual, or other women remains unclear, in part due to inconsistent analysis of available data. We propose an integrated approach that aggregates subgroups to maximize power to detect broadly applicable disparities, then tests for subgroup heterogeneity, exercising caution with disaggregation when there is no direct evidence of heterogeneity.','Multivariate analyses of 2014-2015 National Health Interview Survey data examined six barriers to care. We compared heterosexual women (n = 36,474) with SMW (n = 1048) overall and tested for heterogeneous outcomes among subgroups of SMW compared with heterosexual women and with each other.','Controlling for sociodemographics and health status, aggregated analyses showed that SMW were more likely than heterosexual peers to have trouble finding a provider (adjusted percentages 5.1% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.01) and no optimal usual place of care (14.5% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.01). There was no evidence of subgroup heterogeneity for either barrier, suggesting uniform disparities for SMW. In contrast, only lesbian/gay women were more likely than heterosexual women to be told their health insurance was not accepted (p = 0.03); this was the only outcome for which the adjusted difference between bisexual and lesbian/gay women was significant (2.8% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.02).','Analyses that only disaggregated data would have understated overall sexual minority disparities and perhaps overstated subgroup differences; an integrated approach can more accurately characterize disparities experienced by all SMW versus those specific to certain subgroups. Large national surveys should include sexual orientation questions to support adequately powered comparisons."
"Race/ethnic minorities face significant inequities in stroke incidence, prevalence, care, and outcomes. The Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-solving symposium, a collaborative initiative of the American Heart Association and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, was the first-ever annual multidisciplinary scientific forum focused on race/ethnic inequities in cerebrovascular disease, with the overarching goal of reducing inequities in stroke and accelerating the translation of research findings to improve outcomes for race/ethnic minorities. The symposium featured esteemed invited plenary speakers, lecturing on determinants of race/ethnic inequities in stroke and interventions aimed at redressing the inequities. The Edgar J. Kenton III Award recognized Ralph Sacco, MD, MS, for his lifetime contributions to investigation, management, mentorship, and community service in the field of stroke inequities. Early career investigators were provided with travel awards to attend the symposium; presented their research at moderated poster and Think Tank sessions; received career development advice at the Building Momentum session; and networked with experienced stroke inequities researchers. Future conferences-The Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-solving 2021 to 2024-will broaden the focus to include 5 major persistent inequities (race/ethnic, sex, geographic, socioeconomic, and global). Each year will focus on a different theme (community and stakeholder engagement; clinical trials; implementation science; and policy and dissemination). By fostering a community of stroke inequities researchers, we hope to highlight promising work, illuminate research gaps, facilitate networking, inform policy makers, recognize achievement, inspire greater interest among junior investigators to pursue careers in this field, and provide networking opportunities for underrepresented minority scientists."
"Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an expensive and complex treatment regimen that can be curative in many diseases of the bone marrow, including malignant and non-malignant conditions. The introduction of the Affordable Care Act increased access to potential candidates and removed or reduced many barriers previously identified in the literature, however, racial disparities continue to persist. As HSCT expands its utilization and indications, there is a continued need to understand the multifactorial barriers which lead to inequalities in transplant referral, utilization, and survival. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize these racial disparities, expand the current understanding of the literature, and determine whether the increases in insurance status from Medicaid expansion have played a role in HSCT utilization and survival rates by race.','We explored studies based on retrospective reviews, literature reviews, and focus groups with the key-terms of 'race', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', and 'disparities'. The included studies were extracted from Cochrane and Medline databases. After screening for relevancy to research aims and objectives, 10 articles were utilized for background information and discussion, while 30 articles were categorized into main groups of outcomes, chiefly, (I) access/referral to transplant and (II) survival.','Eight of the eleven retrospective reviews found substantial variation in access to HSCT by ethnic minorities (Black, Hispanic, or Asian) when compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Thirteen of the fourteen publications found racial disparities in either overall survival, progression free survival, treatment related mortality, relapse, or combinations of these outcomes. The majority of the studies evaluated African American patients with six of eight studies showing significantly elevated mortality compared to Caucasian patients.','Substantial variation exists in access to HSCT, particularly in black patients. Having less generous insurance coverage was previously hypothesized to reduce the likelihood of HSCT utilization. Studies performed after full implementation of the Affordable Care Act continue to show poorer survival among ethnic minorities, particularly black patients, despite this increased coverage. Perceived racial bias and health-related stigma, as well as physician decisions and delay in referral process are likely contributing factors."
"Examine whether racial disparities are narrowing or widening with historical time among US middle-aged and older adults, and test the extent to which educational attainment moderates racial disparities over historical time.','Multilevel models were applied to longitudinal data on middle-aged (ages 40-65) and older adults (ages 66 and older) from the Health and Retirement Study. Historical change was indexed as cohort or birth year. The outcomes of focus were depressive symptoms, episodic memory, health conditions, functional limitations, and self-rated health.','Results revealed a differential pattern of racial disparities in historical change between midlife and old age. Across midlife and old age, on average, Blacks and Hispanics reported poorer levels of mental and physical health, compared to Whites. In midlife, racial disparities narrowed with historical time; later-born cohorts of Hispanics but not Whites reported fewer depressive symptoms than their earlier-born peers. Likewise, historical improvements in health were stronger among Hispanics and Blacks than Whites. Conversely, in old age, later-born cohorts across race consistently showed historical improvements in each of the outcomes examined. Regarding educational attainment, we observed little consistent evidence that health-promoting effects of educational attainment would differ across race and cohort. Examining questions about heterogeneity, results revealed that in midlife and old age there was greater heterogeneity between race across each of the outcomes.','Our discussion elaborates on reasons behind the documented racial differences in historical changes among US middle-aged and older adults, and how the protective role of education is changing over time."
"Minority and underresourced communities experience disproportionately high rates of fatal cancer and cardiovascular disease. The intersection of these disparities within the multidisciplinary field of cardio-oncology is in critical need of examination, given the risk of perpetuating health inequities in the growing vulnerable population of patients with cancer and cardiovascular disease. This review identifies 13 cohort studies and 2 meta-analyses investigating disparate outcomes in treatment-associated cardiotoxicity and situates these data within the context of oncologic disparities, preexisting cardiovascular disparities, and potential system-level inequities. Black survivors of breast cancer have elevated risks of cardiotoxicity morbidity and mortality compared with White counterparts. Adolescent and young adult survivors of cancer with lower socioeconomic status experience worsened cardiovascular outcomes compared with those of higher socioeconomic status. Female patients treated with anthracyclines or radiation have higher risks of cardiotoxicity compared with male patients. Given the paucity of data, our understanding of these racial and ethnic, socioeconomic, and sex and gender disparities remains limited and large-scale studies are needed for elucidation. Prioritizing this research while addressing clinical trial inclusion and access to specialist care is paramount to reducing health inequity."
"Health information technology (HIT) can enhance optimal health care access and utilization among individuals living with chronic diseases. This study aimed to provide population-level information on racial/ethnic disparities in HIT use and associated trends among those living with chronic diseases. The study sample consisted of adult respondents (≥18 years) of the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey living with at least 1 chronic condition. Binomial regression was used to analyze the association between race/ethnicity, year, and 4 measures of HIT use for patient-provider interaction. Regression parameter estimates were used to predict the trends in probability of the outcome variables across race/ethnicity. About 73% of the study sample were non-Hispanic Whites, 15% were non-Hispanic Blacks, and 13% were Hispanics. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, there were decreased adjusted odds of any HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.67, 0.76) and Hispanics (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.72, 0.84). The likelihood of any HIT use increased with increasing year (OR: 1.16; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.18). Trends in racial/ethnic disparities were wider for email communication with provider and online prescription refill compared to online scheduling of appointment. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to accelerated adoption or expansion of HIT for patient care. Limited HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics could worsen the disproportionate chronic disease burden, suboptimal clinical outcomes, and preventable health care costs experienced by this subpopulation. In conclusion, there is a need for intentional and strategic population-level interventions to increase HIT adoption and use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics living with chronic diseases."
"To assess tobacco licensing-law strategies (eg, restricting the sale of tobacco near schools, banning the sale of tobacco in pharmacies) in terms of the equity of their impact and ability to correct existing disparities in tobacco retailer density.','We geocoded all 11 392 tobacco retailers in Ohio, categorised neighbourhoods based on their demographic characteristics and calculated current disparities in tobacco retailer density. We next simulated the four main types of licensing-law strategies (capping-based, declustering-based, school-based and pharmacy-based), as well as strategy combinations. Finally, using statistical methods that account for residual spatial dependence, we evaluated how each strategy would impact density disparities.','The most impactful licensing-law strategy depended on the type of community. School-based reductions were equitable for low-income, African-American and urban neighbourhoods (eg, eliminating retailers from 1000 feet of all schools produced a 9.2% reduction in the log retailer rate for neighbourhoods with a low prevalence of African-Americans and a 17.7% reduction for neighbourhoods with a high prevalence of African-Americans). Conversely, capping-based reductions were equitable for rural neighbourhoods. Pharmacy-based reductions demonstrated inequitable impacts.','Licensing-law strategies could be a central tobacco control effort that benefits both the overall population and vulnerable communities. Policymakers will need to consider their community's characteristics when selecting licensing-law strategies to correct (rather than inadvertently widen) density disparities. But when matched with the appropriate strategy, high-risk communities could remove over 20% of their tobacco retailers."
"Breastfeeding is the optimal source of nutrition for most infants (1). Although breastfeeding rates in the United States have increased during the past decade, racial/ethnic disparities persist (2). Breastfeeding surveillance typically focuses on disparities at the national level, because small sample sizes limit examination of disparities at the state or territorial level. However, birth certificate data allow for assessment of breastfeeding initiation among nearly all newborn infants in the United States both nationally and at the state and territorial levels. To describe breastfeeding initiation by maternal race/ethnicity,* CDC analyzed 2019 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) birth certificate data for 3,129,646 births from 48 of the 50 states (all except California and Michigan<sup>†</sup>), the District of Columbia (DC), and three U.S. territories (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico). The prevalence of breastfeeding initiation was 84.1% overall and varied by maternal race/ethnicity, ranging from 90.3% among infants of Asian mothers to 73.6% among infants of Black mothers, a difference of 16.7 percentage points. Across states, the magnitude of disparity between the highest and lowest breastfeeding rates by racial/ethnic groups varied, ranging from 6.6 percentage points in Vermont to 37.6 percentage points in North Dakota, as did the specific racial/ethnic groups with the highest and lowest rates. These state/territory-specific data highlight the variation that exists in breastfeeding disparities across the United States and can help public health practitioners and health departments identify groups on which to focus efforts. Targeting breastfeeding promotion programs on populations with lower breastfeeding rates might help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding initiation and improve infant nutrition and health."
"Health disparities are a persistent problem in many high-income countries. Health policymakers recognize the need to develop systematic methods for documenting and tracking these disparities in order to reduce them. The experience of the U.S., which has a well-established health disparities monitoring infrastructure, provides useful insights for other countries.','This article provides an in-depth review of health disparities monitoring in the U.S. Lessons of potential relevance for other countries include: 1) the integration of health disparities monitoring in population health surveillance, 2) the role of political commitment, 3) use of monitoring as a feedback loop to inform future directions, 4) use of monitoring to identify data gaps, 5) development of extensive cross-departmental cooperation, and 6) exploitation of digital tools for monitoring and reporting. Using Israel as a case in point, we provide a brief overview of the healthcare and health disparities landscape in Israel, and examine how the lessons from the U.S. experience might be applied in the Israeli context.','The U.S. model of health disparities monitoring provides useful lessons for other countries with respect to documentation of health disparities and tracking of progress made towards their elimination. Given the persistence of health disparities both in the U.S. and Israel, there is a need for monitoring systems to expand beyond individual- and healthcare system-level factors, to incorporate social and environmental determinants of health as health indicators/outcomes."
"Sleep is essential for optimal health, well-being, and cognitive functioning, and yet nationwide, youth are not obtaining consistent, adequate, or high-quality sleep. In fact, more than two-thirds of US adolescents are sleeping less than 8 hours nightly on school nights. Racial and ethnic minority children and adolescents are at an increased risk of having shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality than their white peers. In this review, we critically examined and compared results from 23 studies that have investigated racial/ethnic sleep disparities in American school-aged children and adolescents ages 6-19 years. We found that White youth generally had more sufficient sleep than minority youth, Hispanics had more than Blacks, and there was inconclusive evidence for Asians and other minorities. Recommendations for researchers include the following: (1) explore underlying causes of the disparities of these subpopulations, with a particular interest in identifying modifiable causes; (2) examine factors that may be impacted by racial/ethnic sleep disparities; (3) use a multidimensional approach to measuring sleep disparities; and (4) examine how beliefs about sleep are patterned by race/ethnicity. Understanding sleep disparities can inform interventions, policies, and educational programs to minimize sleep disparities and their impact on health, psychological, and educational outcomes."
"We aimed to analyze regional disparities of health care resources in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) county hospitals and their time trends, and to assess the changes of regional disparities before and after 2009 health care reforms.','We used hospital-based, longitudinal data from all TCM county hospitals in China between 2004 and 2016. To measure the key development features of TCM county hospitals, data were collected on government hospital investment, hospital numbers (the average number of TCM hospitals per county), hospital scale (the number of medical staff and hospital beds) and doctors' workload (the daily visits and inpatient stays per doctor). We used segmented linear regression to test the time trend for outcome variables. We set a breakpoint at 2011, dividing the pre-reform (2004-2011) and post-reform (2012-2016) periods.','After the 2009 health reforms, TCM hospitals continued to display large disparities in the number, scale, and doctors' workload across the three regions. In the pre-reform period, yearly government subsidies for TCM hospitals in western area were roughly RMB0.6 million (US$89 thousand) more than those in central and eastern region, which increased under the 2009 reforms to roughly RMB2 million (US$298 thousand) more per yer in post-reform period. These increased subsidies saw an increase in the number of TCM hospitals in the western area, partly addressing regional disparities. But there was no improvement in the regional disparities in terms of scale (number of beds) and the doctors' workload (daily outpatient visits and inpatients per doctor) increased or remained unchanged between the western and other regions.','Although TCM hospital number, scale, and doctors' workload increased over the past 13 years, substantial regional disparities remained. The 2009 health reforms did not significantly change the regional disparities in health care resources, especially between the eastern and western regions."
"Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) has notably evolved with improved patient outcomes over the past few years. Several new drugs have become available, and large national and international clinical trials have set the stage for evidence-based medicine guidelines for the treatment of patients with MM. Although patient outcomes have undoubtedly improved, data increasingly show that several disparities exist at varying levels of health care and that these disparities make the care of patients heterogenous and potentially result in inferior outcomes. These disparities have been described with regard to patient age, race/ethnicity, rural-urban residence, socioeconomic status, and insurance type, among other factors. Looking at the global picture of MM care, there is substantial variation among different countries, primarily depending on the disparate availability of anti-MM drugs and access to quality health care across the world, limiting the delivery of innovative therapeutic approaches at the individual patient level. The causes of these national and international disparities could be multifactorial, intricate, and difficult to isolate. Yet the ongoing research in this field is encouraging, and there seems to be growing momentum to understand such disparities and their causes. It is hoped that this research will lead to solutions that can be implemented in the near future. This review focuses on certain aspects of disparities in MM care, highlighting disparities among different racial/ethnic subgroups, rural-urban differences in America, and global disparities at an international level."
"Health disparities research in the United States over the past 2 decades has yielded considerable progress and contributed to a developing evidence base for interventions that tackle disparities in health status and access to care. However, health disparity interventions have focused primarily on individual and interpersonal factors, which are often limited in their ability to yield sustained improvements. Health disparities emerge and persist through complex mechanisms that include socioeconomic, environmental, and system-level factors. To accelerate the reduction of health disparities and yield enduring health outcomes requires broader approaches that intervene upon these structural determinants. Although an increasing number of innovative programs and policies have been deployed to address structural determinants, few explicitly focused on their impact on minority health and health disparities. Rigorously evaluated, evidence-based structural interventions are needed to address multilevel structural determinants that systemically lead to and perpetuate social and health inequities. This article highlights examples of structural interventions that have yielded health benefits, discusses challenges and opportunities for accelerating improvements in minority health, and proposes recommendations to foster the development of structural interventions likely to advance health disparities research."
"Evaluate narratives aimed at motivating providers with different pre-existing beliefs to address racial healthcare disparities.','Survey experiment with 280 providers. Providers were classified as high or low in attributing disparities to providers (HPA versus LPA) and were randomly assigned to a non-narrative control or 1 of 2 narratives: ""Provider Success"" (provider successfully resolved problem involving Black patient) and ""Provider Bias"" (Black patient experienced racial bias, which remained unresolved). Participants' reactions to narratives (including identification with narrative) and likelihood of participating in disparities-reduction activities were immediately assessed. Four weeks later, participation in those activities was assessed, including self-reported participation in a disparities-reduction training course (primary outcome).','Participation in training was higher among providers randomized to the Provider Success narrative compared to Provider Bias or Control. LPA participants had higher identification with Provider Success than Provider Bias narratives, whereas among HPA participants, differences in identification between the narratives were not significant.','Provider Success narratives led to greater participation in training than Provider Bias narratives, although providers' pre-existing beliefs influenced the narrative they identified with.','Provider Success narratives may be more effective at motivating providers to address disparities than Provider Bias narratives, though more research is needed."
"Racial disparities in hypertension remain a persistent public health concern in the US. While several studies report Black-White differences in the health impacts of gentrification, little is known concerning the impact of living in a gentrifying neighborhood on hypertension disparities. Data from the American Community Survey were used to identify gentrifying neighborhoods across the US from 2006 to 2017. Health and demographic data were obtained for non-Hispanic Black and White respondents of the 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) residing in gentrifying neighborhoods. Modified Poisson models were used to determine whether there is a difference in the prevalence of hypertension of individuals by their race/ethnicity for those that live in gentrifying neighborhoods across the US. When compared to Whites living within gentrifying neighborhoods, Blacks living within gentrifying neighborhoods had a similar prevalence of hypertension. The non-existence of Black-White hypertension disparities within US gentrifying neighborhoods underscores the impact of neighborhood environment on race differences in hypertension."
"Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is a high priority. Reductions in HIV racial/ethnic disparities can potentially be achieved by intervening on important intermediate factors. The potential population impact of intervening on intermediates can be evaluated using observational data when certain conditions are met. However, using standard stratification-based approaches commonly employed in the observational HIV literature to estimate the potential population impact in this setting may yield results that do not accurately estimate quantities of interest. Here we describe a useful conceptual and methodological framework for using observational data to appropriately evaluate the impact on HIV racial/ethnic disparities of interventions. This framework reframes relevant scientific questions in terms of a controlled direct effect and estimates a corresponding proportion eliminated. We review methods and conditions sufficient for accurate estimation within the proposed framework. We use the framework to analyze data on 2,329 participants in the CFAR [Centers for AIDS Research] Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (2008-2014) to evaluate the potential impact of universal prescription of and ≥95% adherence to antiretroviral therapy on racial disparities in HIV virological suppression. We encourage the use of the described framework to appropriately evaluate the potential impact of targeted interventions in addressing HIV racial/ethnic disparities using observational data."
"<b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted significant racial and age-related health disparities. In response to pandemic-related restrictions, orthopedic surgery departments have expanded telemedicine use. We analyzed data from a tertiary care institute during the pandemic to understand potential racial and age-based disparities in access to care and telemedicine utilization. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Data on patient race and age, and numbers of telemedicine visits, in-person office visits, and types of telemedicine were extracted for time periods during and preceding the pandemic. We calculated odds ratios for visit occurrence and type across race and age groups. <b>Results:</b> Patients ages 27-54 were 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.4, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.3, <i>p</i> < 0.05) times more likely to be seen than patients <27 during the pandemic, versus the 2019 and 2020 controls. Patients 54-82 were 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.5, <i>p</i> < 0.001) times more likely to be seen than patients <27 during the pandemic versus the 2019 control. Patients 27-54, 54-82, and 82+, respectively, were 3.3 (95% CI 2.6-4.2, <i>p</i> < 1e-20), 3.5 (95% CI 2.8-4.4, <i>p</i> < 1e-24), and 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.4, <i>p</i> < 0.05) times more likely to be seen by telemedicine than patients <27. Among pandemic telemedicine appointments, Black patients were 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.9, <i>p</i> < 1e-3) times more likely to be seen by audio-only telemedicine than White patients, as compared with video telemedicine. <b>Conclusions:</b> Telemedicine access barriers must be reduced to ensure that disparities during the pandemic do not persist."
"To investigate racial disparities in 30-day postoperative outcomes of craniotomy for glioma resection.','2006-2019 American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program files were queried for all patients who underwent a craniotomy for a supratentorial glioma resection. Racial disparities in preoperative variables were studied between the demographic cohorts of Asian, African Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasian. Fisher exact tests were used to examine association of preoperative variables with race. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for all preoperative variables associated with race, were used to determine the odds ratios of postoperative outcomes for each demographic cohort in comparison with Caucasian patients.','A total of 12,544 patients were identified: 4% Asian, 5% African American, 7% Hispanic, and 85% Caucasian. African American patients had significantly higher adjusted odds than Caucasian patients of major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.827, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.155-2.891, P = 0.01), pulmonary events (aOR: 1.683, 95% CI: 1.145-2.473, P = 0.008), and urinary tract infection (aOR: 2.016, 95% CI: 1.221-3.327, P = 0.006). Asian patients had significantly higher odds than Caucasian patients of requiring a transfusion (aOR: 2.094, 95% CI: 1.343-3.266, P = 0.001). All demographic cohorts had higher odds of having an extended length of stay than Caucasian patients.','African American patients who undergo a craniotomy for glioma resection have almost twice the odds of Caucasian patients of having a postoperative major cardiovascular complication, pulmonary complication, or urinary tract infection. All minority groups have higher odds of an extended length of stay as compared with Caucasian patients."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the structural inequities facing communities of color and its consequences in lives lost. However, little is known about the COVID-related disparities facing Asian Americans amidst the heightened racism and violence against this community. We analyze the mortality toll of COVID-19 on Asian Americans using multiple measures. In 2020, one in seven Asian American deaths was attributable to COVID-19. We find that while Asian Americans make up a small proportion of COVID-19 deaths in the USA, they experience significantly higher excess all-cause mortality (3.1 times higher), case fatality rate (as high as 53% higher), and percentage of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (2.1 times higher) compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Mounting evidence suggest that disproportionately low testing rates, greater disease severity at care presentation, socioeconomic factors, and racial discrimination contribute to the observed disparities. Improving data reporting and uniformly confronting racism are key components to addressing health inequities facing communities of color."
"Previous studies have reported healthcare disparities in the Texas-Mexico border population. Our aim was to evaluate treatment utilization and oncologic outcomes of colon cancer patients in this vulnerable population.','Patients with localized and regional colon cancer (CC) were identified in the Texas Cancer Registry (1995-2016). Clinicopathological data, hospital factors, receipt of optimal treatment, and overall survival (OS) were compared between Texas-Mexico Border (TMB) and the Non-Texas-Mexico Border (NTMB) cohorts. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with decreased survival.','We identified 43,557 patients with localized/regional CC (9% TMB and 91% NTMB). TMB patients were more likely to be Hispanic (73% versus 13%), less likely to have private insurance (13% versus 21%), were more often treated at safety net hospitals (82% versus 22%) and less likely at ACS-CoC accredited hospitals (32% versus 57%). TMB patients were more likely to receive suboptimal treatment (21% versus 16%) and had a lower median OS for localized (8.58 versus 9.58 y) and regional colon cancer (5.75 versus 6.18 y, all P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, TMB status was not associated with worse OS. Factors associated with worse survival included receipt of suboptimal treatment, Medicare/insured status, and treatment in safety net and non-accredited ACS-CoC hospitals (all P < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: While TMB CC patients had worse OS, TMB status itself was not found to be a risk factor for decreased survival. This survival disparity is likely associated with higher rate of suboptimal treatment, Medicare/Uninsured status, and decreased access to ACS-CoC accredited hospitals."
"Racial-ethnic disparities in technology use have been described in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). It is not known whether these emerge early in disease management. This single-center retrospective study examined disparities in continuous glucose monitor (CGM) initiation and durability in the first-year after diagnosis of T1D in children. Of 345 eligible children, 46% started CGM within their first year. In non-Hispanic white (NHW) children, 51% started using CGM versus 28% of non-Hispanic black (NHB) children (<i>P</i> = 0.006). After stratifying by commercial/government insurance, a proxy for socioeconomic status, this difference persisted among those with commercial insurance. One-year post-CGM initiation, 96% (125/130) of NHW children were using CGM versus 73% (11/15) of NHB children (<i>P</i> = 0.003). Disparities in CGM use emerge early in care of children with T1D, with lower rates of initiation and sustained use of CGM in NHB children. Strategies addressing causes of these disparities should begin early in T1D management."
"There is growing evidence of disparities in access to hospice and palliative care services to varying degrees by sociodemographic groups. Underlying factors contributing to access issues have received little systematic attention.','To synthesize current literature on disparities in access to hospice and palliative care, highlight the range of sociodemographic groups affected by these inequities, characterize the domains of access addressed, and outline implications for research, policy, and clinical practice.','An integrative review comprised a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases, which was conducted from inception to March 2020 for studies outlining disparities in hospice and palliative care access in the United States. Data were analyzed using critical synthesis within the context of a health care accessibility conceptual framework. Included studies were appraised on methodological quality and quality of reporting.','Of the articles included, 80% employed non-experimental study designs. Study measures varied, but 70% of studies described differences in outcomes by race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Others revealed disparate access based on variables such as age, gender, and geographic location. Overall synthesis highlighted evidence of disparities spanning 5 domains of access: Approachability, Acceptability, Availability, Affordability, and Appropriateness; 60% of studies primarily emphasized Acceptability, Affordability, and Appropriateness.','This integrative review highlights the need to consider various stakeholder perspectives and attitudes at the individual, provider, and system levels going forward, to target and address access issues spanning all domains."
"Differences in preterm birth rates between black and white women are the largest contributor to racial disparities in infant mortality. In today's age of precision medicine, analysis of the genome, epigenome, metabolome, and microbiome has generated interest in determining whether these biomarkers can help explain racial disparities. We propose that there are pitfalls as well as opportunities when using precision medicine analyses to interrogate disparities in health. To conclude that racial disparities in complex conditions are genetic in origin ignores robust evidence that social and environmental factors that track with race are major contributors to disparities. Biomarkers measured in omic assays that may be more environmentally responsive than genomics, such as the epigenome or metabolome, may be on the causal pathway of race and preterm birth, but omic observational studies suffer from the same limitations as traditional cohort studies. Confounding can lead to false conclusions about the causal relationship between omics and preterm birth. Methodological strategies (including stratification and causal mediation analyses) may help to ensure that associations between biomarkers and exposures, as well as between biomarkers and outcomes, are valid signals. These epidemiologic strategies present opportunities to assess whether precision medicine biomarkers can uncover biology underlying perinatal health disparities."
"Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers in the United States that is increasing in incidence. Little is known about racial disparities in incidence and mortality. We characterized racial disparities in pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality in different locations, time periods, age groups, and disease stages.','We obtained data on the incidence of pancreatic cancer from the National Program of Cancer Registries and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of cancer registries from 2001 through 2015 on incidence, demographics, tumor characteristics, and population estimates for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We obtained data on mortality from pancreatic cancer from the National Center for Health Statistics during the same time period. We plotted incidence rates by 10-year age group (30-39 years through 70-79 years and 80 years or older) separately for white and black patients. We calculated incidence and mortality rate ratios with 95% CIs for categories of age and race. To determine racial disparities, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) for black vs white patients and mortality rate ratios by state.','Disparities in pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality in black vs white patients decreased over 5-year time periods from 2001 through 2015. However, among all age groups, from 2001 through 2015, pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality were higher among blacks than whites (incidence, 24.7 vs 19.4 per 100,000; IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.26-1.29; mortality, 23.3 vs 18.4 per 100,000; IRR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.26-1.28). Black patients had a higher incidence of distant pancreatic cancer (IRR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.31-1.34) and a lower incidence of local cancer. Incidence increased in whites and blacks of younger age groups and was most prominent among persons 30-39 years old. Incidence increased by 57% among younger whites (IRR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.43-2.02) and by 44% among blacks (IRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01-2.15) from 2001 through 2015. Mortality remained stable among blacks and slightly increased among whites during this time period.','In the United States, there are racial disparities in pancreatic incidence and mortality that vary with location, patient age, and cancer stage. Further research is needed to identify factors associated with increasing incidence and persistence of racial disparities in pancreatic cancer."
"Despite increased recognition of disparities in youth mental health, racial/ethnic disparities in mental health burden and in mental health service use persist. This phenomenon suggests that research documenting disparities alone has not led to extensive action in practice settings in order to significantly reduce disparities. In this commentary, we present a framework to actively target this research-to-practice gap by describing the development of a resource titled, ""Addressing the Mental Health Needs of Racial and Ethnic Minority Youth-A Guide for Practitioners."" We begin by presenting social justice as the impetus for eliminating disparities and then reviewing current knowledge and efforts aimed at reducing disparities. Subsequently, we describe knowledge transfer frameworks and goals guiding our work. Finally, we detail the steps taken in our approach to translation and implications for subsequent dissemination of this guide. Translation focused on evidence-based information on (a) mechanisms that contribute to disparities, and (b) strategies for providers to address disparities in their work. We reflect on the framework guiding our translation to offer future directions for others interested in bridging research and action. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."
"Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer amongst women worldwide. In the United States, its incidence and mortality have been declining due to the wide scale implementation of cytological screening programs. However, there have been geographic disparities in cervical cancer, particularly in the US.','This review will outline the overall incidence of cervical cancer and discuss the causes for disparities in its incidence and mortality rates.','A literature review was performed from 1999 to 2020 of English language manuscripts on the incidence and reasons for disparities in mortality rates of cervical cancer.','Racial and ethnic minorities, socioeconomically disenfranchised, and those in rural areas have disparate rates of vaccination, screening and treatment of cervical cancer, leading to worse outcomes.','By addressing these disparities via increased education, access to care, and the expansion of screening and vaccination programs, reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality may be achieved."
"Racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in HIV diagnosis rates exist among women in the United States. Black/African American women are disproportionately affected; rates are highest in the South and Northeast. Monitoring progress towards eliminating disparities in HIV diagnosis rates among women is a national HIV prevention goal. To illustrate the performance of different measures of disparities, we compared 2012 and 2017 HIV diagnosis rates among adult and adolescent females by race/ethnicity and geographic region. We used HIV surveillance data for diagnoses and five absolute and three relative measures of disparity. The absolute disparity decreased in each region; the relative disparity decreased with the exception of one measure in the Northeast and South. Despite progress, disparities in HIV diagnosis rates among women remain. Appropriate strategies to measure progress and contextualize findings are needed."
"Despite numerous studies on educational disparities in U.S. adult health, explanations for the disparities and their growth over time remain incomplete. We argue that this knowledge gap partly reflects an individualist paradigm in U.S. studies of educational disparities in health. These studies have largely focused on proximal explanations (e.g., individual behaviors) to the neglect of contextual explanations (e.g., economic policies). We draw on contextual theories of health disparities to illustrate how U.S. states, as institutional actors, shape the importance of education for health. Using two nationally-representative datasets and seven health measures for adults aged 45-89, we show that the size of the educational gradient in health varies markedly across states. The size varies because of variation in the health of lower-educated adults. We use state excise taxes on cigarettes to illustrate one way that states shape educational disparities in health. Our findings underscore the necessity of contextualizing these disparities."
"Assessing disparities in health-related quality of Life (HRQoL) is important as a part of health-related disparities in the society. The aim of this study was to explore HRQoL among 12-year-olds in Sweden in terms of differences between years 2005 and 2009 and disparities related to sociodemographic background.','During the school years 2005 and 2009, a total of 18,325 sixth grade students in Sweden were invited to a celiac disease screening study; 13,279 agreed to participate. Jointly with the celiac screening, the children answered a questionnaire that included EuroQol 5 Dimensions-youth (EQ-5D-Y) and their parents responded to separate questionnaires about their own and their child's country of birth, family structure, their employment status, occupation, and education. In total 11,009 child-parent questionnaires were collected. Logistic regression was used to study differences in HRQoL between 2005 and 2009, and between various sociodemographic subgroups.','Compared with 2005, children in 2009 reported more pain (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and more mood problems (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.2-1.5). In general, girls reported more pain and mood problems and had more disparities than boys. There were no significant differences based on parents' occupation, however, children of parents with low or medium education levels reported less ""mood problems"" than those of parents with high education levels (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.92) and (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.96), respectively. A slight variation was seen in HRQoL between children with different migration background. Girls living in small municipalities reported more pain (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.14-2.01), and problems performing usual activities (OR: 3.77, 95% CI: 2.08-6.84), compared to girls living in large municipalities. In addition, children living with two parents had less mood problems than children living in other family constellations.','More children reported pain and mood problems in 2009 compared with 2005. To study future trends, health outcomes among children in Sweden should continue to be reported periodically. More efforts should be invested to increase the awareness of health-related disparities as highlighted in this study especially for girls living in small municipalities and children of parents with high education level."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of death in men worldwide, after adjusting for age. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, continents such as North America and Europe report higher incidence of PCa; however, mortality rates are highest among men of African ancestry in the western, southern, and central regions of Africa and the Caribbean. The American Cancer Society reports, African Americans (AAs), in the United States, have a 1.7 increased incidence and 2.4 times higher mortality rate, compared to European American's (EAs). Hence, early population history in west Africa and the subsequent African Diaspora may play an important role in understanding the global disproportionate burden of PCa shared among Africans and other men of African descent. Nonetheless, disparities involved in diagnosis, treatment, and survival of PCa patients has also been correlated to socioeconomic status, education and access to healthcare. Although recent studies suggest equal PCa treatments yield equal outcomes among patients, data illuminates an unsettling reality of disparities in treatment and care in both, developed and developing countries, especially for men of African descent. Yet, even after adjusting for the effects of the aforementioned factors; racial disparities in mortality rates remain significant. This suggests that molecular and genomic factors may account for much of PCa disparities."
"<b>Objective:</b> Health disparities related to basic medical insurance in China have not been sufficiently examined, particularly among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to investigate the disparities in HCC survival by insurance status in Tianjin, China. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective analysis used data from the Tianjin Basic Medical Insurance claims database, which consists of enrollees covered by Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI). Adult patients newly diagnosed with HCC between 2011 and 2016 were identified and followed until death from any cause, withdrawal from UEBMI or URRBMI, or the latest data in the dataset (censoring as of December 31st 2017), whichever occurred first. Patients' overall survival during the follow-up was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and extrapolated by six parametric models. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with the adjusted Cox proportional hazards model including age at diagnosis, sex, baseline comorbidities and complications, baseline healthcare resources utilization and medical costs, tumor metastasis at diagnosis, the initial treatment after diagnosis and antiviral therapy during the follow-up. <b>Results:</b> Two thousand sixty eight patients covered by UEBMI (<i>N</i> = 1,468) and URRBMI (<i>N</i> = 570) were included (mean age: 60.6 vs. 60.9, <i>p</i> = 0.667; female: 31.8 vs. 27.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.074). The median survival time for patients within the UEBMI and URRBMI were 37.8 and 12.2 months, and the 1-, 3-, 5-, 10-year overall survival rates were 63.8, 50.2, 51.0, 33.4, and 44.4, 22.8, 31.5, 13.1%, respectively. Compared with UEBMI, patients covered by URRBMI had 72% (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.47-2.00) higher risk of death after adjustments for measured confounders above. The survival difference was still statistically significant (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.21-1.83) in sensitivity analysis based on propensity score matching. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study reveals that HCC patients covered by URRBMI may have worse survival than patients covered by UEBMI. Further efforts are warranted to understand healthcare disparities for patients covered by different basic medical insurance in China."
"Kentucky is recognized as the state with the highest lung cancer burden for more than 2 decades, but how lung cancer differs in Kentucky relative to other US populations is not fully understood.','We examined lung cancer reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program by Kentucky and the other SEER regions for patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2016. Our analyses included histologic types, incidence rates, stage at diagnosis, and survival in Kentucky and Appalachian Kentucky relative to other SEER regions.','We found that both squamous cell carcinomas and small-cell lung cancers represent larger proportions of lung cancer diagnoses in Kentucky and Appalachian Kentucky than they do in the SEER registries. Furthermore, age-adjusted cancer incidence rates were higher in Kentucky for every subtype of lung cancer examined. Most notably, for Appalachian women the rate of small-cell carcinomas was 3.5-fold higher, and for Appalachian men the rate of squamous cell carcinoma was 3.1-fold higher, than the SEER rates. In Kentucky, lung cancers were diagnosed at later stages and lung cancer survival was lower for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinomas than in SEER registries. Squamous cell carcinomas and small-cell carcinomas were most lethal in Appalachian Kentucky.','Together, these data highlight the considerable disparities among lung cancer cases in the United States and demonstrate the continuing high burden and poor survival of lung cancer in Kentucky and Appalachian Kentucky. Strategies to identify and rectify causes of these disparities are discussed."
"An essential measure of hip fracture (HF) rehabilitation, the amount of physical therapy (PT) used per patient, has been severely understudied. This study (1) evaluates post-acute PT use after HF in Estonia, (2) presents causal variation modelling for examining inter- and intra-regional disparities, and (3) analyses its temporal trends.','This retrospective cohort study used validated population-wide health data, including patients aged ≥50 years, with an index HF diagnosed between January 2009 and September 2017. Patients' 6-month PT use was analysed and reported separately for acute and post-acute phases.','While most of the included 11,461 patients received acute rehabilitation, only 40% of them received post-acute PT by a median of 6 h. Analyses based on measures of central tendency revealed 2.5 to 2.6-fold inter-regional differences in HF post-acute rehabilitation. Variation modelling additionally detected intra-regional disparities, showing imbalances in the fairness of allocating local rehabilitation resources between a county's patients.','This study demonstrates the advantages of causal variation modelling for identifying inter- and intra-regional disparities in rehabilitation. The analyses revealed persisting large multi-level disparities and accompanying overall inaccessibility of PT in HF rehabilitation in Estonia, showing an urgent need for system-wide improvements.Implications for rehabilitationThis study demonstrates the advantages of causal variation modelling for identifying inter- and intra-regional disparities in rehabilitation, using an essential outcome measure - used physical therapy hours.The study revealed large multi-level disparities and overall inaccessibility of physical therapy in hip fracture rehabilitation in Estonia, showing an urgent need for system-wide improvements.This study expands our knowledge on unstudied topics - hip fracture post-acute care and long-term physical therapy use.This regional analysis provides the first evidence-based regional-level basis for improving the rehabilitation system in Estonia."
"Little is known about the role that transplant centers may play in perpetuating racial disparities after liver transplantation, which are unexplained by patient-level factors. We examined variation in between-center and within-center disparities among 34,114 Black and White liver transplant recipients in the United States from 2010 to 2017 using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) data. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate transplant center-specific Black-White hazard ratios and hierarchical survival analysis to examine potential effect modification of the race-survival association by transplant center characteristics, including transplant volume, proportion of Black patients, SRTR quality rating, and region. Models were sequentially adjusted for clinical, socioeconomic, and center characteristics. After adjustment, Black patients experienced 1.11 excess deaths after liver transplant per 100 person-years compared with White patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.56), corresponding to a 21% increased mortality risk (95% CI, 1.12-1.31). Although there was substantial variation in this disparity across transplant centers, there was no evidence of effect modification by transplant center volume, proportion of minority patients seen, quality rating, or region. We found significant racial disparities in survival after transplant, with substantial variation in this disparity across transplant centers that was not explained by selected center characteristics. This is the first study to directly evaluate the role transplant centers play in racial disparities in transplant outcomes. Further assessment of the qualitative factors that may drive disparities, such as selection processes and follow-up care, is needed to create effective center-level interventions to address health inequity."
"Effects of disparities in socioeconomic status (SES) on late-life disabilities have been reported around the world. However, there are only a few studies that have examined age, period, and cohort dependent influences of SES disparities on late-life disabilities. We investigated associations between SES disparities and late-life disability based on the Age-Period-Cohort. We also investigated how macro-economic conditions unique to a period, or a cohort might explain the period or the cohort trends.','Data were obtained from people aged 65 and over that responded to the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, which had been conducted every three years from 1989 to 2013. SES was assessed via household income. Disability was assessed as disabilities in performing Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Income disparities were evaluated by the slope index of inequality (SII) and the relative index of inequality (RII). Each Age-Period-Cohort dimension was simultaneously controlled using a model for cross-classification of random effects.','Differences in BADL disabilities due to income disparities decreased with age and reversed after approximately 80 years of age. Income disparities in BADL disability changed across periods, by increasing in periods with a high unemployment rate, which started two to four years before the period. Moreover, results of using SII and RII were nearly identical.','Higher mortality in elderly with lower income might be related to a reduction of income disparities in BADL disability in Japan. Furthermore, exposure to harsh economic conditions might contribute to increased disparities in BADL disability a few years later."
"Reducing rural-urban disparities in health and health care has been a key policy goal for the Chinese government. With mental health becoming an increasingly significant public health issue in China, empirical evidence of disparities in the use of mental health services can guide steps to reduce them. We conducted this study to inform China's on-going health-care reform through examining how health insurance might reduce rural-urban disparities in the utilization of mental health inpatient services in China. This retrospective study used 10 years (2005-2014) of hospital electronic health records from the Shandong Center for Mental Health and the DaiZhuang Psychiatric Hospital, two major psychiatric hospitals in Shandong Province. Health insurance was measured using types of health insurance and the actual reimbursement ratio (RR). Utilization of mental health inpatient services was measured by hospitalization cost, length of stay (LOS), and frequency of hospitalization. We examined rural-urban disparities in the use of mental health services, as well as the role of health insurance in reducing such disparities. Hospitalization costs, LOS, and frequency of hospitalization were all found to be lower among rural than among urban inpatients. Having health insurance and benefiting from a relatively high RR were found to be significantly associated with a greater utilization of inpatient services, among both urban and rural residents. In addition, an increase in the RR was found to be significantly associated with an increase in the use of mental health services among rural patients. Consistent with the existing literature, our study suggests that increasing insurance schemes' reimbursement levels could lead to substantial increases in the use of mental health inpatient services among rural patients, and a reduction in rural-urban disparities in service utilization. In order to promote mental health care and reduce rural-urban disparities in its utilization in China, improving rural health insurance coverage (e.g., reducing the coinsurance rate) would be a powerful policy instrument."
"It is important to understand racial/ethnic differences in adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), given their relationship to long-term physical and mental health, and the public health cost of the significant disparities that exist. Moreover, in order to inform interventions and promote resilience, it is critical to examine protective factors that mitigate the relationship between adversity and poor health. The current study utilized latent transition analyses (LTA) to examine co-occurring profiles of ACEs and protective factors (from school, family, and community contexts) and links to health outcomes among 30,668 Black (10.4%), Latinx (12.3%), and White youth (77.3%) ages 12-17 (52.5% male) who participated in the 2011-12 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). Results suggested that greater adversity was associated with worse health, while more access to protective factors was associated with better health. White youth had consistently lower endorsement of ACEs, greater access to protective factors, and better health compared to their Black and Latinx counterparts. Efforts to improve child health and racial/ethnic disparities in research and practice must consider adversity, protective factors, and the systemic inequities faced by racial/ethnic minority youth in the United States."
"Surgical disparities exist. Certain surgical populations suffer from disproportionately worse access, care, and outcomes in surgery. Opportunities exist to better identify, understand, and reduce these disparities. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways use standardized perioperative processes and a multidisciplinary philosophy to deliver best-evidence surgical care to all patients. As a result, ERAS provides a uniquely pragmatic model for improving outcomes and reducing disparities in vulnerable surgical populations. The value of ERAS may therefore extend beyond its traditional benefits to the even greater pursuit of health equity."
"The study of disparities across diverse populations regarding the health and treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) is recognized as a priority for investigation and action by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS). OA is a common condition that increases with age, but with prevalence generally similar across racial and ethnic groups. However, disparities in the treatment of OA among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups are well-documented and continue to rise and persist. The reasons are complex, likely involving a combination of patient, provider, and healthcare system factors. Treatment disparities among these different populations have an impact on clinical outcomes, healthcare, and productivity, and are projected to increase significantly with the growing diversity of the United States population. The aim of this short review is to summarize studies of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities among patients with OA in the United States, with a focus on prevalence, treatment utilization, and clinical and economic outcomes."
"Systemic racism can have broad impacts on health in ethnoracial minorities. One way is by suppressing socioeconomic status (SES) levels through barriers to achieve higher income, wealth, and educational attainment. Additionally, the weathering hypothesis proposes that the various stressful adversities faced by ethnoracial minorities lead to greater wear and tear on the body, known as allostatic load. In the present study, we extend these ideas to cognitive health in a tri-ethnic sample of young adults-when cognition and brain health is arguably at their peak. Specifically, we tested competing mediation models that might shed light on how two key factors caused by systemic racism-SES and perceived stress-intersect to explain ethnoracial disparities in cognition. We found evidence for partial mediation via a pathway from SES to stress on episodic memory, working memory capacity, and executive function in Black Americans relative to non-Hispanic White Americans. Additionally, we found that stress partially mediated the ethnoracial disparities in working memory updating for lower SES Black and Hispanic Americans relative to non-Hispanic White Americans, showing that higher SES can sometimes reduce the negative effects stress has on these disparities in some cognitive domains. Overall, these findings suggest that multiple pathways exist in which lower SES creates a stressful environment to impact ethnoracial disparities cognition. These pathways differ depending on the specific ethnoracial category and cognitive domain. The present results may offer insight into strategies to help mitigate the late-life risk for neurocognitive disorders in ethnoracial minorities."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has uncovered long-standing health disparities in marginalized communities, including racial and ethnic minorities and children with underlying medical and social problems. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans have higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths than their population percentages in the United States. Unique populations of children, including children with developmental disabilities, children in the foster care system, children with chronic medical problems, and children who are homeless are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This article explores how the COVID-19 pandemic superimposed on health disparities directly and indirectly affects children, adolescents, and their caregivers."
"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Nearly half of U.S. women experienced new or worsening health-related socioeconomic risks (HRSRs) (food, housing, utilities and transportation difficulties, and interpersonal violence) early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine racial/ethnic disparities in pandemic-related changes in HRSRs among women. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We conducted a cross-sectional survey (04/2020) of 3200 women. Pre- and early pandemic HRSRs were described by race/ethnicity. Weighted, multivariable logistic regression models generated odds of incident and worsening HRSRs by race/ethnicity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The majority of Black, East or Southeast (E/SE) Asian, and Hispanic women reported ≥1 prepandemic HRSR (51%-56% vs. 38% of White women, <i>p</i> < 0.001). By April 2020, 68% of Black, E/SE Asian, and Hispanic women and 55% of White women had ≥1 HRSR (<i>p</i> < 0.001). For most HRSRs, the odds of an incident or worsening condition were similar across racial/ethnic groups, except Black, E/SE Asian and Hispanic women had 2-3.6 times the odds of incident transportation difficulties compared with White women. E/SE Asian women also had higher odds of worsening transportation difficulties compared with White women (adjusted odds ratios = 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-5.6). In the early pandemic, 1/19 Hispanic, 1/28 E/SE Asian, 1/36 Black and 1/100 White women had all 5 HRSRs (extreme health-related socioeconomic vulnerability). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Prepandemic racial/ethnic disparities in HRSRs persisted and prevalence rates increased for all groups early in the pandemic. Disparities in transportation difficulties widened. White women were much less likely than others to experience extreme health-related socioeconomic vulnerability. An equitable COVID-19 response requires attention to persistent and widening racial/ethnic disparities in HRSRs among women."
"There have been tremendous advances in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer in the past decade, yet we are failing to achieve equitable outcomes for all patient populations. Disparities exist in the incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer. Inequities are based on racial and ethnic group, sex, socioeconomic status, and geography. To address disparities, future steps must focus on research methods, including collection and methodology, and policy measures, including access, patient tools, hospital incentives, and workforce diversity. Through these comprehensive efforts, we can begin to rectify inequitable care for treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer."
"Racial and ethnic minority status, structural racism, low educational attainment, and poverty are consistently associated with cancer disparities and with higher rates of incarceration. The objective of this scoping review is to conduct a qualitative synthesis of the literature on cancer prevalence, incidence, mortality, and disparities in these outcomes for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated patients, as this literature is fragmented and heterogenous.','This scoping review included Bureau of Justice Statistics reports and searched PubMed in May 2021 for all English language studies published between 1990 and 30 April 2021, that reported on cancer prevalence, incidence, or mortality for incarcerated or formerly incarcerated individuals in the United States.','Twenty studies were selected. Data on cancer prevalence and incidence were scarce but suggested that incarcerated and formerly incarcerated patients have a similar overall risk of cancer diagnosis as the general population, but elevated risk of certain cancers such as cervical, lung, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma for which effective prevention and screening interventions exist. Cancer mortality data in state and local jails as well as prisons were robust and suggests that both incarcerated and formerly incarcerated patients have higher cancer mortality than the general population.','Incarcerated and formerly incarcerated patients likely have a higher risk of dying from cancer than the general population, but important gaps in our knowledge about the extent and drivers of disparities for this population remain. Additional research is needed to guide interventions to reduce cancer disparities for patients experiencing incarceration."
"Racial and ethnic minorities experience well-documented disparities across the cancer trajectory. However, factors underlying these disparities may vary regionally. The Health Belief Model (HBM) was developed to explain and predict health-related prevention and early detection behaviors, particularly uptake of health services. Our goal was to use the HBM to guide an exploration of factors that contribute to racial/ethnic health disparities in the catchment area of a large National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the Southeastern United States.','We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected by the cancer center for its triennial Community Health Needs Assessment, which sampled adults from the center's 15-county catchment area. White non-Hispanics (WNHs; n = 887), Black non-Hispanics (BNHs; n = 78), Hispanics/Latinxs (H/Ls; n = 185), and those identifying as another race/ethnicity (""Others""; n = 39) were compared across key HBM variables, including demographic/psychosocial information, perceived benefits and barriers to preventive health behaviors, risk perception, and health behavior outcomes.','Controlling for annual household income, relationship status, and age (for certain screening behaviors), significant differences were seen in information-seeking behaviors, risk perception, community attributes, discrimination, and distress. Non-WNH groups reported worse community attributes, higher everyday discrimination, lower health literacy, less confidence in their ability to get health information, and lower perceived risk of cancer.','This analysis presents a better understanding of how HBM factors may influence health disparities in the cancer center's catchment area. Results describe the needs of community members from racial and ethnic minority groups, which will inform future research, education, outreach, and service activities."
"Sinonasal adenocarcinoma (SNAC) is a rare tumor. The impact of health disparities on survival, stage at presentation, and utilization of surgery is not well understood in patients with SNAC.','The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for cases of SNAC from 1973 to 2015. Cases were analyzed to assess for disparities in presentation, treatment, and survival.','SNAC was identified in 630 patients. In a multivariate model of overall survival, an age increase of 10 years (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.37, p < 0.001), male sex (HR = 1.26, p = 0.045), and more recent decade of diagnosis (HR = 0.74, p < 0.001) were significantly related to time-to-death. There is a higher rate of SNAC-related death in counties with more rural populations (p = 0.027).','Future interventions targeting rural and less well-educated populations may improve care with the goal of increasing the span of healthy life and reducing survival disparities related to SNAC."
"Although oral health has improved remarkably in recent decades, not all populations have benefited equally. Ethnic identity, and in particular visible minority status, has been identified as an important risk factor for poor oral health. Canadian research on ethnic disparities in oral health is extremely limited. The aim of this study was to examine ethnic disparities in oral health outcomes and to assess the extent to which ethnic disparities could be accounted for by demographic, socioeconomic and caries-related behavioral factors, among a population-based sample of grade 1 and 2 schoolchildren (age range: 5-8 years) in Alberta, Canada.','A dental survey (administered during 2013-14) included a mouth examination and parent questionnaire. Oral health outcomes included: 1) percentage of children with dental caries; 2) number of decayed, extracted/missing (due to caries) and filled teeth; 3) percentage of children with two or more teeth with untreated caries; and 4) percentage of children with parental-ratings of fair or poor oral health. We used multivariable regression analysis to examine ethnic disparities in oral health, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and caries-related behavioral variables.','We observed significant ethnic disparities in children's oral health. Most visible minority groups, particularly Filipino and Arab, as well as Indigenous children, were more likely to have worse oral health than White populations. In particular, Filipino children had an almost 5-fold higher odds of having severe untreated dental problems (2 or more teeth with untreated caries) than White children. Adjustment for demographic, socioeconomic, and caries-related behavior variables attenuated but did not eliminate ethnic disparities in oral health, with the exception of Latin American children whose outcomes did not differ significantly from White populations after adjustment.','Significant ethnic disparities in oral health exist in Alberta, Canada, even when adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and caries-related behavioral factors, with Filipino, Arab, and Indigenous children being the most affected."
"To investigate food democracy and health disparities in the New York City (NYC) trans fat policy process.','Texts from semi-structured interviews, public testimony and comments on the policy were analysed using categorization and thematic coding. A priori content analysis for themes of food democracy was followed by open, axial and selective coding for sub-themes on health disparities. Data and method triangulation and respondent validation were used to establish data dependability, trustworthiness and representativeness.','NYC.','Interviews from a purposive, snowballed sample of thirty-three participants included restaurateurs, scientists, health and consumer advocates, consumers and policy makers. Additionally, 261 pages of transcript from public testimony of fifty-three participants and a purposive sample of public comments on the policy from a pool of 2157 were analysed.','Principles of food democracy involving inclusive citizenship, access to information, collaborative participation and focus on collective good were well represented in the data. Additionally, sub-themes linked to health disparities included: government responsibility for fairer access to healthier foods; recognition that people made choices based on circumstances; concern for vulnerable groups; and outrage with a food industry viewed as unconcerned for public health.','Principles of food democracy present in the successful process of adoption of the 2006 NYC trans fat policy addressed nutrition-related health. Food democracy is a contemporary food system and policy approach with potential for public health benefits in reducing nutrition-related health disparities."
"Variability in pediatric morbidity and mortality tends to be influenced by several factors including though not limited to social determinants of health, namely health inequity as an exposure function of health disparities. We aimed to assess the cumulative incidence of pediatric mortality, racial/ethnic disparities, and the predisposing factors for the disparities.','The current study retrospectively examined the Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children medical records of 16,121 patients diagnosed with any pediatric condition during 2009 and 2010.','In-hospital pediatric mortality cumulative incidence was relatively low (80 deaths, 0.49%) when compared with similar settings in the U.S. (national average range, 0.8e1.1%) during the same period. Compared with whites/Caucasians, mortality was higher among blacks/African Americans, prevalence odds ratio (POR), 1.06, 95% CI, 0.77e1.45, and higher for some other race, POR, 1.48, 95% CI, 1.06e2.10. After controlling for potential confounders (severity of illness, insurance status, and length of stay), racial differences in pediatric mortality did not persist between whites and some other race, adjusted POR, 1.08, 99% CI, 0.75e1.57.','In-hospital pediatric mortality cumulative incidence was relatively low in our region, and racial disparities exist but did not persist after controlling for confounders. These findings are suggestive of the importance of social determinants of health namely quality care, adequate medical insurance, and early detection, diagnosis in pediatric morbidity and epigenomic alterations, as well as the need to go beyond the ""close medical model"" to improve pediatric morbidity and survival by addressing health inequity as a function of health disparities."
"Increasing light is being shed on how race, insurance, and socioeconomic status (SES) may be related to outcomes from disease in the United States. To better understand the impact of these health care disparities in pediatric neurosurgery, we performed a systematic review of the literature.','We conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines and MeSH terms involving neurosurgical conditions and racial, ethnic, and SES disparities. Three independent reviewers screened articles and analyzed texts selected for full analysis.','Thirty-eight studies were included in the final analysis, of which all but 2 were retrospective database reviews. Thirty-four studies analyzed race, 22 analyzed insurance status, and 13 analyzed SES/income. Overall, nonwhite patients, patients with public insurance, and patients from lower SES were shown to have reduced access to treatment and greater rates of adverse outcomes. Nonwhite patients were more likely to present at an older age with more severe disease, less likely to undergo surgery at a high-volume surgical center, and more likely to experience postoperative morbidity and mortality. Underinsured and publicly insured patients were more likely to experience delay in surgical referral, less likely to undergo surgical treatment, and more likely to experience inpatient mortality.','Health care disparities are present within multiple populations of patients receiving pediatric neurosurgical care. This review highlights the need for continued investigation into identifying and addressing health care disparities in pediatric neurosurgery patients."
"The impact of race, socioeconomic status (SES), insurance status, and other social metrics on the outcomes of patients with intracranial tumors has been reported in several studies. However, these findings have not been comprehensively summarized.','We conducted a PRISMA systematic review of all published articles between 1990 and 2020 that analyzed intracranial tumor disparities, including race, SES, insurance status, and safety-net hospital status. Outcomes measured include access, standards of care, receipt of surgery, extent of resection, mortality, complications, length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, readmission rate, and hospital charges.','Fifty-five studies were included. Disparities in mortality were reported in 27 studies (47%), showing minority status and lower SES associated with poorer survival outcomes in 14 studies (52%). Twenty-seven studies showed that African American patients had worse outcomes across all included metrics including mortality, rates of surgical intervention, extent of resection, LOS, discharge disposition, and complication rates. Thirty studies showed that privately insured patients and patients with higher SES had better outcomes, including lower mortality, complication, and readmission rates. Six studies showed that worse outcomes were associated with treatment at safety-net and/or low-volume hospitals. The influence of Medicare or Medicaid status, or inequities affecting other minorities, was less clearly delineated. Ten studies (18%) were negative for evidence of disparities.','Significant disparities exist among patients with intracranial tumors, particularly affecting patients of African American race and lower SES. Efforts at the hospital, state, and national level must be undertaken to identify root causes of these issues."
"In the United States, women are at a higher risk of developing vision impairment or a serious eye disease (such as age-related macular degeneration, thyroid eye disease, or chronic dry eye disease) than men. Disparities in eye diseases due to biology widen even further when considering factors such as social determinants of health; gaps in research data, literature, and policy; insufficient provider and patient education; and limitations in screening and treatment options. Sex and gender disparities in eye health are clinically under-addressed and burdensome on both patient quality of life and the health care and economic systems, resulting in a pressing population health issue that negatively impacts women.','The Society for Women's Health Research convened a working group of expert clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates to review the current state of science regarding sex and gender disparities in women's eye health, identify knowledge gaps and unmet needs, and explore better means to advance research, improve patient care, and raise awareness of key issues.','The SWHR Women's Eye Health Working Group identified priority areas in research, clinical care, and education to reduce disparities and improve patient care in women's eye health. The working group recommends using a systems approach that incorporates a comprehensive research framework with a sex and gender lens to guide future work and that increases health care provider and public education, as well as engagement by expanding partnerships among ophthalmologic providers, researchers, and non-vision stakeholders."
"Black women experience higher rates of cardiotoxicity and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related comorbidities than White women. These racial and ethnic disparities are primarily from the earlier onset of CVD risk factors, social determinants of health (SDOH), and cardiotoxicity screening and surveillance disparities.','This article discusses the role of SDOH in cardio-oncology and strategies to prevent and detect adverse cardiovascular outcomes among Black breast cancer survivors.','Preliminary case study findings are presented, including treatment exposures to cardiotoxicity and SDOH in cardio-oncology influencing health outcomes in Black breast cancer survivors.','Nurses can address SDOH and racial disparities in cardio-oncology by being mindful of Black breast cancer survivors' increased burden of CVD risk factors, evaluating barriers to receive preventive care and cardio-oncology rehabilitation, practicing cultural humility, and adhering to evidence-based guidelines for behavioral risk management for Black breast cancer survivors."
"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women world-wide and the most common cause of cancer deaths, which can often be managed with early diagnosis and subsequent treatment. Here, we focus on geographic disparities in incidence within Portugal for three age groups of women (30-49; 50-69; 70-84 years).','Age-period-cohort (APC) models are widely used in cancer surveillance, and these models have recently been extended to allow spatially-varying effects. We apply novel spatial APC models to estimate relative risk and age-adjusted temporal trends at the district level for the 20 districts in Portugal. Our model allows us to report on country-wide trends, but also to investigate geographic disparities between districts and trends within districts.','Age-adjusted breast cancer incidence was increasing over 1998-2011 for all three age groups and in every district in Portugal. However, we detect spatially-structured between-district heterogeneity in relative risk and age-adjusted trends (Net Drifts) for each of the three age groups, which is most pronounced in the highly-screened (50-69yo) and late-onset (70-84yo) groups of women.','We present evidence of disparities in breast cancer incidence at a more granular geographic level than previously reported. Some disparities may be due to latent risk factors, which cannot be accounted for by age, birth year, and geographic location alone.','Our study motivates resuming data collection for breast cancer incidence at the district level in Portugal, as well as the study of exogenous risk factors."
"Cancer screening rates declined sharply early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic may have exacerbated existing disparities in cancer screening due to the disproportionate burden of illness and job loss among racial/ ethnic minorities, and potentially, uneven resumption of care between different racial/ ethnic groups. Using electronic health record data from Mass General Brigham (MGB), we assessed changes in rates of breast, cervical, colorectal and lung cancer screening before and during the pandemic. Among patients who received primary care in an MGB-affiliated primary care practice, cancer screening rates were calculated as the number of individuals who received a screening test for each cancer type over the number of individuals due for each test, during each month between April 2019-November 2020. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to test for changes in screening rates by race/ethnicity before and during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, relative to White individuals, Asian women were less likely to receive breast cancer screening (p < 0.001), and Latinx and Black individuals were less likely to screen for lung cancer (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02). Our results did not show significant improvement or worsening of racial/ethnic disparities for any cancer screening type as screening resumed. However, as of November 2020 rates of screening for breast cancer were lower than pre-pandemic levels for Latinx individuals, and lung cancer screening rates were higher than baseline for Latinx, Black or White individuals. Further monitoring of disparities in cancer screening is warranted as the pandemic evolves."
"Children belonging to the same birth cohort (i.e., born in the same year) experience shared exposure to a common obesity-related milieu during the critical early years of development-e.g., secular beliefs and feeding practices, adverse chemical exposures, food access and nutrition assistance policies-that set the stage for a shared trajectory of obesity as they mature. Fundamental cause theory suggests that inequitable distribution of recent efforts to stem the rise in child obesity may exacerbate cohort-based disparities over time.','Data were from electronic health records spanning 2007-2016 linked to birth records for children ages 2-19 years. We used hierarchical age-period-cohort models to investigate cohort effects on disparities in obesity related to maternal education. We hypothesized that maternal education-based disparities in prevalence of obesity would be larger among more recent birth cohorts.','Sex-stratified models adjusted for race/ethnicity showed substantial obesity disparities by maternal education that were evident even at young ages: prevalence among children with maternal education < high school compared to maternal college degree was approximately three times as high among girls and twice as high among boys. For maternal education < high school, disparities compared to maternal college degree were higher in more recent birth cohorts. Among girls, this disparity cohort effect was evident at younger ages (at age 4, the disparity increased by 4 [0.1-8] percentage points per 5 birth years), while among boys it was larger at older ages (at age 16, the disparity increased by 7 [1-14] percentage points per 5 birth years).','There may be widening maternal education-based disparities in child obesity by birth cohort at some ages."
"Research shows that population-level rates of obesity, which rose dramatically from the 1970s through the mid-2000s, have since plateaued or even started to decline. However, overall improvements may mask differences in trends for different subgroups. For instance, obesity rates have continued to climb among low-income adolescents, leading to growing income-related gaps in obesity. By comparison, we know little about whether income-related disparities have also changed among elementary school children. To address this gap, we examined two cohorts of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten cohort, which followed children entering school in 1998 and 2010. We hypothesized that income-related disparities in obesity have also grown larger over time among young children.','We used data from nationally representative samples of children who entered kindergarten in 1998 and 2010. We documented rates of overweight and obesity from kindergarten through third grade, examined how rates differed for children from high- and low-income families, and tested whether income-related disparities changed over time.','Rates of overweight and obesity were 2 to 5 percentage points higher in the later cohort, and overall increases masked substantial variation by income. Specifically, these increases were driven by children in lower-income households, resulting in substantially larger income-related disparities in overweight and obesity in the later cohort.','As we hypothesized, income-related disparities in young children's obesity grew between 1998 and 2014. This suggests that efforts to curb increasing rates of obesity may have been more successful for higher-income families. We discuss potential mechanisms that may account for increasing disparities."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in hospital readmissions following total joint arthroplasty present opportunities for reducing cost and improving health equity. Despite efforts to reduce readmissions following total joint arthroplasty in the general population, no studies have documented the impact of these efforts on racial and ethnic disparities in total joint arthroplasty readmissions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether comprehensive efforts to reduce hospital readmissions following total joint arthroplasty have impacted racial and ethnic disparities in readmission rates during the period from 2005 to 2015.','We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing patients readmitted and not readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of a total joint arthroplasty by estimating logistic regression models for clustered data using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) in R. Connecticut hospital discharge data for patients admitted for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) procedure codes 81.51 and 81.54 (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes 27130 and 27447) during the 2005 to 2015 U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) fiscal years were analyzed. Models included quadratic terms to capture nonlinear time trends in readmissions, as well as terms for the statistical interaction between race or ethnicity and both the linear and quadratic time trends in predicting the odds of readmission.','There were 102,510 total admissions to Connecticut hospitals for total joint arthroplasty from 2005 to 2015. The 30-day (all-cause) readmission rate declined from 5.1% in 2005 to 3.6% in 2015, with a steeper downward trend observed from 2009 to 2015. The results from logistic models indicated that black patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.68; p < 0.0001) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.48; p < 0.0001) were significantly more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge following a total joint arthroplasty than white patients over the study period. The significant interaction of black race and the quadratic time trend in models capturing nonlinear trends in readmission over time indicated that the readmission rates for black patients increased compared with those for white patients from 2005 through 2008 and decreased relative to those for white patients from 2009 to 2015 (OR, 0.24; p = 0.030).','Data from Connecticut hospitals show that 30-day readmissions following a total joint arthroplasty declined by 1.5 percentage points from 2005 to 2015, and that this decline was much more pronounced among black patients, resulting in the narrowing of racial disparities in readmission following a surgical procedure.','Racial and ethnic minorities have historically been at increased risk for complications and readmission following hospital-based surgical care. This analysis of readmission following total joint arthroplasty reveals that such disparities are remediable and should foster further research on the primary drivers of and remedies for readmission disparities."
"Although there is a growing body of literature describing the scope and impact of mental health disparities, there is relatively less literature focused on youth and on interventions that are grounded in the cultures of youth most significantly affected by disparities. From the perspective of Hawai'i, one of the world's most diverse communities where disparities nonetheless exist, the authors review the varieties of diversity encountered in psychiatry and healthcare, specific youth mental health disparities, and examples of locally tailored solutions.','Mental health disparities are born from the differential exposures to poverty, trauma, discrimination, and barriers to accessing care, especially mental healthcare, which is nationally in short supply. They exist even in supposedly high-resource settings and significantly impact indigenous populations, including in terms of risk for incarceration and risk for suicidal behavior.','Addressing disparities involves insuring access to preventive and treatment-focused mental healthcare and applying cultural humility in clinical and community settings. The authors add to the reviewed literature by highlighting interventions that are population-based, culturally grounded, and focused on indigenous youth."
"Most familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients remain undertreated, and it is unclear what role health disparities may play for FH patients in the US. We sought to describe sex and racial/ethnic disparities in a national registry of US FH patients.','We analyzed data from 3167 adults enrolled in the CAscade SCreening for Awareness and DEtection of Familial Hypercholesterolemia (CASCADE-FH) registry. Logistic regression was used to evaluate for disparities in LDL-C goals and statin use, with adjustments for covariates including age, cardiovascular risk factors, and statin intolerance.','In adjusted analyses, women were less likely than men to achieve treated LDL-C of <100 mg/dL (OR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.57-0.82) or ≥50% reduction from pretreatment LDL-C (OR 0.79, 95% CI, 0.65-0.96). Women were less likely than men to receive statin therapy (OR, 0.60, 95% CI, 0.50-0.73) and less likely to receive a high-intensity statin (OR, 0.60, 95% CI, 0.49-0.72). LDL-C goal achievement also varied by race/ethnicity: compared with whites, Asians and blacks were less likely to achieve LDL-C levels <100 mg/dL (Asians, OR, 0.47, 95% CI, 0.24-0.94; blacks, OR, 0.49, 95% CI, 0.32-0.74) or ≥50% reduction from pretreatment LDL-C (Asians, OR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.32-0.98; blacks, OR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.43-0.90).','In a contemporary US population of FH patients, we identified differences in LDL-C goal attainment and statin usage after stratifying the population by either sex or race/ethnicity. Our findings suggest that health disparities contribute to the undertreatment of US FH patients. Increased efforts are warranted to raise awareness of these disparities."
"Latino youth experience worse access to and utilization of health care compared with non-Latino ""white"" youth, with inequities persisting following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). To better understand these disparities, we examine changes in youth's access and utilization associated with the ACA for different Latino heritage groups relative to whites.','We use 6 years (2011-2016) of National Health Interview Survey data to examine Latino youth's insurance coverage and health care utilization by heritage group, nativity, and parental language. The dependent measures of utilization included well-child, emergency department, and physician visits. We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the odds of each dependent measure and interacted heritage group and time period [2011-2013 (pre-ACA) versus 2014-2016 (post-ACA)] to examine how changes associated with the ACA varied by group.','Insurance coverage and well-child visits improved among youth overall following implementation of the ACA. Although Mexican and Central or South American youth experienced the largest absolute increase in coverage, they still had high levels of uninsurance post-ACA (9.9% and 9.1%, respectively). Disparities in coverage between Puerto Rican and white youth improved, while disparities in well-child visits between Mexican and white youth worsened. Little to no movement was observed in disparities by nativity and parental language.','Most disparities in insurance and utilization across Latino heritage groups and white youth persisted post-ACA despite significant gains within groups. Although disparities for Puerto Rican youth have improved, Mexican and Central or South American youth continue to experience disparities."
"The United States (US) has identified income-based disparities in smoking as a critical public health issue, but the extent to which these disparities are changing over time within states is not well documented. This study examined recent trends in current cigarette smoking in each state and the District of Columbia by self-reported annual household income. Data came from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a state-representative survey of US adults. Sample sizes for each state and year ranged from 2914 to 36,955 participants. We fit logistic regression models to examine linear time trends in cigarette smoking status in each state between 2011 and 2017. In every state, the odds of smoking were 1.4 to 3.0 times greater in the lower-income group as compared to the higher-income group in 2017. Among 47 states, linear time trends in smoking did not significantly differ by income group, suggesting no change in income-based disparities. In three states (Florida, Maine, West Virginia) disparities widened, primarily because smoking prevalence only dropped among higher-income groups. Disparities declined in only one state. In New York, smoking prevalence declined more for lower-income groups compared to higher-income groups. Findings from this study suggest that little progress has been made toward reducing income-based differences in smoking and additional policy and tobacco control efforts may be required to meet national disparity reduction goals."
"<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging are only partly attributable to socioeconomic indicators. Psychosocial factors, such as discrimination and perceived control, also differ across racial/ethnic groups, and emerging literature highlights their potential role in contributing to cognitive disparities in addition to socioeconomic status. <b><i>Method:</i></b> 1,463 older adults (51% Hispanic, 27% non-Hispanic Black, and 22% non-Hispanic White) in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project completed cognitive and psychosocial measures, including a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, Everyday and Major Experiences of Lifetime Discrimination scales, and the Perceived Control scale. Mediation models quantified separate indirect effects of Black race and Hispanic ethnicity on global cognitive composite scores through education, income, discrimination, and external perceived control. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Educational attainment, income, and perceived control each mediated racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition. Socioeconomic indicators (i.e., lower education and lower income) explained approximately 50% of the Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in global cognition, and more external perceived control explained an additional 5%-8%. Hispanics reported the lowest levels of discrimination, while non-Hispanic Blacks reported the highest levels. However, neither everyday nor major lifetime discrimination was associated with global cognition. Significant racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition remained after accounting for the included socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This study suggests that psychosocial factors may explain racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging above and beyond socioeconomic indicators. More external perceived control, which could reflect chronic exposure to interpersonal and institutional marginalization, may be a particularly salient psychosocial risk factor for poorer cognitive aging among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may exacerbate existing racial/ethnic inequities in preterm birth.','To assess whether racial/ethnic disparities in very preterm birth (VPTB) and preterm birth (PTB) increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City.','This cross-sectional study included 8026 Black, Latina, and White women who gave birth during the study period. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of Black vs White disparities in VPTB or PTB in a pandemic cohort was compared with a prepandemic cohort by using electronic medical records obtained from 2 hospitals in New York City.','Women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2020, were considered the pandemic cohort, and women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2019, were considered the prepandemic cohort. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were performed using samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab at the time of admission.','Clinical estimates of gestational age were used to calculate VPTB (<32 weeks) and PTB (<37 weeks). Log binomial regression was performed to estimate Black vs White risk differences, pandemic cohort vs prepandemic cohort risk difference, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator. Covariate-adjusted models included age, insurance, prepregnancy body mass index, and parity.','Of 3834 women in the pandemic cohort, 492 (12.8%) self-identified as Black, 678 (17.7%) as Latina, 2012 (52.5%) as White, 408 (10.6%) as Asian, and 244 (6.4%) as other or unspecified race/ethnicity, with approximately half the women 25 to 34 years of age. The prepandemic cohort comprised 4192 women with similar sociodemographic characteristics. In the prepandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.4% (20 of 451) and PTB risk was 14.4% (65 of 451) among Black infants compared with 0.8% (17 of 2188) VPTB risk and 7.1% (156 of 2188) PTB risk among White infants. In the pandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.3% (21 of 491) and PTB risk was 13.2% (65 of 491) among Black infants compared with 0.5% (10 of 1994) VPTB risk and 7.0% (240 of 1994) PTB risk among White infants. The DID estimators indicated that no increase in Black vs White disparities were found (DID estimator for VPTB, 0.1 additional cases per 100 [95% CI, -2.5 to 2.8]; DID estimator for PTB, 1.1 fewer case per 100 [95% CI, -5.8 to 3.6]). The results were comparable in covariate-adjusted models when limiting the population to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. No change was detected in Latina vs White PTB disparities during the pandemic.','In this cross-sectional study of women who gave birth in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic, no evidence was found for increased racial/ethnic disparities in PTB, among women who tested positive or tested negative for SARS-CoV-2."
"We sought to quantify socioeconomic disparities in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at an urban, tertiary referral center.','This retrospective case-control study identified 67 patients with severe AS (aortic valve [AV] area ≤1 cm<sup>2</sup> or AV area index ≤0.60 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> or AV velocity ≥40 mmHg) who underwent TAVR from November 5, 2013 to June 10, 2014. Study subjects were matched to controls with severe AS without TAVR in a 4:1 age-frequency match. Demographic data were collected using electronic medical records. Area-based median household income was obtained by geocoding patients' addresses and linking with census data. Charlson comorbidity index for all subjects was calculated.','Income disparity was significant in that with every $10,000 increase in income, the odds of receiving TAVR increased by 10% (p = 0.05). Non-blacks were significantly more likely to receive TAVR than blacks (odds ratio [OR] 2.812, confidence interval [CI] 1.007-7.853; p = 0.048). No differences in comorbidities were found between the two groups. Post hoc analysis to identify etiologies of the found disparities examined differences of AV area and AV area index, indication for two-dimensional echocardiography (echo), symptoms prior to echo, and action after echo within the control group. Black race significantly impacted the TAVR status despite the same AV area (OR 0.33, CI 0.09-0.97, p = 0.043). After echo, blacks were more likely to decline AVR, be lost to follow-up, and not be referred to cardiology (OR 4.41, CI 1.43-13.64; p = 0.010).','Socioeconomic and racial disparities were associated with patients with severe AS receiving TAVR at a major referral center. This study emphasizes the importance of improving access to standard of care for these subgroups of cardiac patients."
"The impact of household language on Latino-White and Latino intragroup disparities in child health and having a medical home in the United States is poorly understood. This study aimed to examine these disparities 1) between Whites and Latinos (overall and stratified by English-primary-language [EPL] and non-English-primary-language [NEPL] households); 2) within Latinos, stratified by household language; and 3) potential moderation of disparities by social determinants.','Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative sample of children 0 to 17 years old from the 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health. We evaluated associations of child race/ethnicity and household language with child health and presence of a medical home. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare groups of interest, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health needs. Moderation was assessed using interaction terms for household income, parental educational attainment, and child insurance coverage.','Among 81,514 children, 13.5% were NEPL Latino, and 19.4% were EPL Latino. Compared with EPL Whites, both EPL and NEPL Latinos had reduced odds of excellent/very good health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-0.84; and aOR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.33-0.53) and presence of a medical home (aOR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.56-0.69; and aOR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.37-0.54), respectively. Among Latinos, NEPL (vs EPL) was also associated with reduced odds of excellent/very good health (aOR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.46-0.83), and presence of a medical home (aOR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48-0.78); these associations were magnified by adverse social determinants.','Striking Latino-White and within-Latino medical-home disparities persist in the United States, particularly for NEPL Latino children.

"There are racial and socioeconomic disparities in the care of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Bellevue Hospital Center (BHC) in New York City is the oldest public hospital in the United States providing care to a multiracial, socioeconomically diverse and medically underserved population. We investigated racial and social disparities in providing care to patients with PD and related disorders at BHC compared to a NYU Langone Health, a Parkinson's Foundation Center of Excellence. Retrospective chart review of patients with diagnosis of PD or PD-related disorders evaluated at BHC or at NYU outpatient clinics from January 2012 to August 2017. 100 patients were enrolled from each site: BHC (55% men); NYU (49% men). The majority of patients at NYU were White (77%), compared to 14% at BHC; Hispanic patients comprised the majority at BHC (56%) (p < 0.001). BHC patients had more clinic visits per year compared to the NYU cohort (2.88 vs. 2.40, p = 0.001). BHC patients were less likely to self-report exercise (p = 0.047) or participation in physical therapy (p = 0.015). There were no clinically significant differences in diagnosis type, time to diagnosis, average Hoehn & Yahr or levodopa equivalent dose. Compared to a Parkinson's Foundation Center of Excellence, PD patients in a public hospital system are more racially diverse, are less likely to be insured, have higher rates of care utilization and are less likely to access necessary interventions such as physical therapy and exercise."
"Sexual minority and racial/ethnic minority youth experience a higher burden of asthma. The frameworks of minority stress theory and intersectionality suggest that sexual minority and racial/ethnic minority youth may experience disparities in nonremitting asthma.','To examine adjusted odds of nonremitting asthma by sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and their intersections, along with their relationship with traditional nonremitting asthma risk factors (weight status and smoking) and victimization (bullying, cyberbullying, and forced sex).','We used data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey pooled across 41 jurisdiction-years (biennially, 2009-2017), resulting in a sample of 21,789 US youth. The prevalence of nonremitting asthma was examined by sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and their intersections, stratified by sex. Bivariate associations and backward logistic regression models, stratified by sex, were built to examine nonremitting asthma disparities and the effects of selected traditional correlates and victimization variables.','At the intersections, 8 sexual minority and racial/ethnic minority subpopulations were significantly more likely to have nonremitting asthma compared with White heterosexual sex-matched peers. White gay males and Black lesbian females had the highest odds of nonremitting asthma. Traditional risks of nonremitting asthma and victimization were associated with attenuated odds of nonremitting asthma.','Many sexual minority and racial/ethnic youth subpopulations are more likely to have nonremitting asthma. Evidence suggests that traditional nonremitting asthma risk factors and victimization may partly explain disparities in nonremitting asthma. Asthma management guidelines should be updated to include population health disparities of sexual and racial/ethnic minorities."
"Although readmission rates are declining under Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), concerns remain that the HRRP will harm quality at safety-net hospitals because they are penalized more often. Disparities between white and black patients might widen because more black patients receive care at safety-net hospitals. Disparities may be particularly worse for clinical conditions not targeted by the HRRP because hospitals might reallocate resources toward targeted conditions (acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and heart failure) at the expense of nontargeted conditions.','To examine disparities in readmission rates between white and black patients discharged from safety-net or non-safety-net hospitals after the HRRP began, evaluating discharges for any clinical condition and the subsets of targeted and nontargeted conditions.','Cohort study conducting quasi-experimental analyses of patient hospital discharges for any clinical condition among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries from 2007 to 2015 after controlling for patient and hospital characteristics. Changes in disparities were measured within safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals after the HRRP penalties were enforced and compared with prior trends. These analyses were then stratified by targeted and nontargeted conditions. Analyses were conducted from October 1, 2017, through August 31, 2018.','Trends in 30-day readmission rates among white and black patients by quarter and differences in trends across periods.','The study sample included 58 237 056 patient discharges (black patients, 9.8%; female, 57.7%; mean age [SD] age, 78.8 [7.9] years; nontargeted conditions, 50 372 806 [86.5%]). Within safety-net hospitals, disparities in readmission rates for all clinical conditions widened between black and white patients by 0.04 percentage point per quarter in the HRRP penalty period (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.07; P = .01). This widening was driven by nontargeted conditions (0.05 percentage point per quarter [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.08]; P = .006), whereas disparities for the HRRP-targeted conditions did not change (with an increase of 0.01 percentage point per quarter [95% CI, -0.07 to 0.10]; P = .74). Within non-safety-net hospitals, racial disparities remained stable in the HRRP penalty period across all conditions, whether the conditions were HRRP-targeted or nontargeted.','Findings from this study suggest that disparities are widening within safety-net hospitals, specifically for non-HRRP-targeted conditions. Although increases in racial disparities for nontargeted conditions were modest, they represent 6 times more discharges in our cohort than targeted conditions."
"The aim of this study was to identify sex-stratified trends in victimization risk specific to heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning youth while considering changes in sexual orientation-disparities from 2009 to 2017.','Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data collected biennially (five waves; 2009-2017) were pooled across 56 jurisdictions and 454,715 students for one of the most nationally representative samples of heterosexual and sexual minority youth to date. We analyzed a seven-item victimization risk assessment using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended trend analysis approach. We used logistic regression with year-by-identity interactions to test whether sexual orientation-based disparities widened, narrowed, or were maintained over time.','Victimization risk declined significantly for male and female bisexual and questioning youth, lesbian, gay, and heterosexual youth. Disparities narrowed between bisexual, questioning, and lesbian females and heterosexual females and between bisexual and heterosexual males. Nevertheless, sexual orientation-based disparities remained significant for all sexual minority youth in 2017.','Distinct patterns of change in victimization risk for specific groups of sexual minority youth underscore the need to consider variability within sexual minority youth communities; treating them as a singular group could mask nuanced disparities. Some of the relatively small decreases in victimization risk also suggest the need for interventions to address a more comprehensive set of victimization-related risks beyond bullying and needed efforts that are not limited to the immediate school context."
"Reducing health disparities for sexual and gender minority (SGM) people is a priority of the National Institutes of Health. SGM populations face barriers in cancer prevention, treatment, and survivorship care. These barriers are due to deficits in researcher and provider training and education, as well as limited National Cancer Institute funding opportunities directed at the many different SGM populations. SGM status intersects with race and ethnicity, education, geography, and poverty to exacerbate disparities further. SGM cancer research will inform SGM patient cancer care guidelines and promote best practices in care among cancer providers. Cancer professionals may benefit from tailored training to enhance their research readiness for SGM cancer care. Research readiness can promote conduct of high-impact SGM cancer research and expand the limited knowledge of SGM cancer care disparities. Here, we propose a coordinated national plan for the training and education of health science researchers and oncology providers as a key strategy to reduce SGM cancer health disparities experienced along the cancer care continuum. We describe unrecognized clinical cancer care needs of SGM patients and unmet opportunities for research partnership and offer strategies for developing flexible educational training programs, courses, and workshops to prepare researchers and healthcare providers to promote health equity and quality cancer care for members of the SGM community."
"Despite the well-described benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on long-term health outcomes, CR is a resource that is underutilized by a significant proportion of patients that suffer from cardiovascular diseases. The main purpose of this study was to examine disparities in CR referral and participation rates among individuals from rural communities and racial and ethnic minority groups with coronary heart disease (CHD) when compared to the general population.','A systematic search of standard databases including MedlLine, PubMed, and Cochrane databases was conducted using keywords that included cardiac rehabilitation, women, race and ethnicity, disparities, and rural populations. Twenty-eight clinical studies from 1990 to 2017 were selected and included 478,955 patients with CHD.','The majority of available clinical studies showed significantly lower CR referral and participation rates among individuals from rural communities, women, and racial and ethnic groups when compared to the general population. Similar to geographic region, socioeconomic status (SES) appears to directly impact the use of CR programs. Patients of lower SES have significantly lower CR referral and participation rates than patients of higher SES.','Data presented underscores the need for systematic referrals using electronic health records for patients with CHD in order to increase overall CR referral and participation rates of minority populations and other vulnerable groups. Educational programs that target healthcare provider biases towards racial and ethnic groups may help attenuate observed disparities. Alternative modalities such as home-based and internet-based CR programs may also help improve CR participation rates among vulnerable populations."
"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Laparoscopic surgery has become the standard of care for many surgical treatments. The diffusion of laparoscopy has been investigated for adult patient populations but is still unknown for pediatric populations. This study sought to describe national trends in diffusion of laparoscopic surgery for common pediatric conditions and identify disparities in use of laparoscopic surgery. <b><i>Study Design:</i></b> A retrospective analysis of serial cross-sectional data was performed using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Kids' Inpatient Database from 1997 to 2016. Pediatric patients (ages ≤18) undergoing appendectomy, cholecystectomy, fundoplication, or inguinal hernia repair were identified. The diffusion of laparoscopy for each procedure was measured using the proportion of laparoscopic surgeries over years. <b><i>Results:</i></b> National trends demonstrate increases in the use of laparoscopy for children over the past two decades from 13.4% to 88.7% for appendectomy, from 82.6% to 94.9% for cholecystectomy, from 7.4% to 77.4% for fundoplication, and from 1.5% to 23.5% for repair of inguinal hernia (<i>P</i> < .001). Disparities in diffusion of laparoscopy were found from various pediatric populations, and the disparities varied by specific procedures and years. In particular, the proportion of laparoscopic appendectomy in 1997 was 11.3% at urban teaching hospitals and was 13.9% at rural hospitals (<i>P</i> = .01), while the proportions in 2016 increased to 90.8% at urban teaching hospitals versus 71.3% at rural hospitals (<i>P</i> < .001). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Laparoscopy has become the standard surgical care for common pediatric surgical conditions. Widening disparities in use of laparoscopic surgery for pediatric populations appear between urban teaching hospitals and rural hospitals."
"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Racial-ethnic disparities in diabetes technology use are well documented in young adults (YA) with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but modifiable targets for intervention still need to be identified. Our objective was to explore YA perspectives on technology access and support in routine clinical care. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Participants were YA with T1D of Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black race-ethnicity from pediatric and adult endocrinology clinics in the Bronx, NY. We conducted semistructured individual interviews to explore how health care and personal experiences affected technology use. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis. We used a modified inductive coding approach with two independent coders and iterative coding processes to improve data reliability and validity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We interviewed 40 YA with T1D: mean age 22 years; 62% female; 72% Medicaid insured; 72% Hispanic; 28% non-Hispanic Black; and mean hemoglobin A1C 10.3%. Themes were categorized into potentially exacerbating and alleviating factors of racial-ethnic disparities in technology use. Exacerbating factors included perceptions that providers were gatekeepers of information and prescription access to technology, providers did not employ shared decision making for use, and YA biases against technology were left unaddressed. Alleviating factors included provider optimism and tailoring of technology benefits to YA needs, and adequate Medicaid insurance coverage. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our results reveal potential intervention targets at the provider level to increase technology uptake among underrepresented YA with T1D. Diabetes health care providers need to be aware of inadvertent withholding of information and prescription access to technology. Provider approaches that address YA technology concerns and promote shared decision making help to mitigate racial/ethnic disparities in technology use."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in the use of nine common autism-related services among Medicaid-enrolled children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were examined, distinguishing between school and other community-based outpatient settings. Using 2012 Medicaid Analytic Extract data, we identified 117,848 continuously enrolled children with ASD. Several racial and ethnic disparities were found, varying by geography. Black, Asian, and Native American/Pacific Islanders received fewer outpatient services compared with white children, but there was no disparity for Latinx children. Black and Asian children received more school-based services than white children. Disparities in case management/care coordination services were largest and present in each minority group. Geographic variation in receipt of services suggests targets for policy intervention to improve access for minorities with ASD."
"This study examined the regional and geographical disparities in body mass index (BMI) among Chinese older adults. Using panel data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, participants included 3,740 older adults (age ≥ 65 years) who answered all three waves of the survey (2009-2014). Sex-stratified and multistate Cox regression was used to examine the disparities in BMI change. Results showed that both older males and older females who resided in the central-south had lower rates of weight change from nonobese to obese, compared with those from the east. Older females from urban regions had higher rate of weight change from nonobese to obese, compared with rural participants (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.13, 1.60]; <i>p</i> < .01). However, there were no disparities between urban and rural areas among older males (<i>p</i> > .05). These results provided practical implications for regional and geographical disparities in BMI among Chinese older adults."
"This review assessed evidence of disparities in benefits of pharmacogenomics related to 'model performance' in subgroups of patients and studies which reported impact on health inequalities. 'Model performance' refers to the ability of algorithms including clinical, environmental and genetic information to guide treatment. A total of 4978 abstracts were screened by one reviewer and 30% (1494) were double screened by a second independent reviewer, after which data extraction was performed. Additional forward and backward citation searching of reference lists was conducted. Investigators independently double rated study quality and applicability of included studies. Only five individual studies were identified which met our inclusion criteria, but were contradictory in their conclusions. While three studies of genotype-guided dosing of warfarin reported that ethnic disparities in healthcare may widen, two other studies (one reporting on warfarin and reporting on clopidogrel) suggested that disparities in healthcare may reduce. There is a paucity of studies which evaluates the impact of pharmacogenomics on health disparities. Further work is required not only to evaluate health disparities between ethnic groups and countries but also within ethnic groups in the same country and solutions need to be identified to overcome these disparities."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated significantly worse outcomes for minority (black and Hispanic) individuals. Understanding the reasons for COVID-19-related disparities among patients with asthma has important public health implications.','To determine factors contributing to health disparities in those with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic.','An anonymous survey was sent through social media to adult patients with asthma, and a separate survey was sent to physicians who provide asthma care. The patient survey addressed demographic information including socioeconomic status, asthma control, and attitudes/health behaviors during COVID-19.','A total of 1171 patients (10.1% minority individuals) and 225 physicians completed the survey. Minority patients were more likely to have been affected by COVID-19 (eg, became unemployed, lived in a community with high COVID-19 cases). They had worse asthma control (increased emergency visits for asthma, lower Asthma Control Test score), were more likely to live in urban areas, and had a lower household income. Initial differences in attitudes and health behaviors disappeared after controlling for baseline demographic features. Institutional racism was demonstrated by findings that minority individuals were less likely to have a primary care physician, had more trouble affording asthma medications due to COVID-19, and were more likely to have lost health insurance because of COVID-19, and that 25% of physicians found it more challenging to care for black individuals with asthma during COVID-19.','Differences in socioeconomic status and the effects of institutional racism, but not health behaviors, sources of information, or attitudes, are playing a role in disparities seen for patients with asthma during COVID-19."
"To determine how income-based disparities in a yearly dental visit (the Healthy People 2020 Leading Health Indicator for Oral Health) changed since legislation to expand dental coverage and to compare disparity trends in children and adults.','We analyzed Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 1997 to 2016 to determine yearly dental visit rates for US children and adults by family income. We determined measures of income disparity, including the Slope Index of Inequality and the Relative Index of Inequality and examined trends in yearly dental visit, Slope Index of Inequality, and Relative Index of Inequality using joinpoint regression.','Income-based disparities, absolute and relative, narrowed over time for children. Steady upward trends in yearly dental visit rates were observed for poor and low-income/poor children and no joinpoint was identified that corresponded to legislation expanding dental care coverage for lower income children. Relative income-based disparities in yearly dental visit rates widened for adults over 20 years. After declining for 14 years, yearly dental visit rate increased for poor adults from 2013 to 2016 suggesting a possible positive effect in adult dental care use trends following enactment of the Affordable Care Act.','In 1997, US children and adults had similar levels of income-based disparity in yearly dental visits, but by 2016, they differed markedly. Trends in income-based disparities in yearly dental visit rate narrowed for children but widened for adults. There are lessons from the expansion of dental care coverage for children that could be applied to improve access to dental care for adults."
"In 2000, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education issued a standard for cultural competence for medical students, stating the necessity of understanding different belief systems and cultures and how biases can affect health care and perpetuate health disparities. While many programs travel overseas to address this standard, our study evaluated an in-state, study-away, service-learning mission trip program's efficacy of improving cultural competence and awareness of health disparities, as well as facilitating the ease of participation for students. Our overall goal was to provide a rich field opportunity in our own backyard that would allow students to visit a foreign environment without leaving the country, simultaneously eliminating the financial burden that comes with international travel and to expose the students to health disparities through partnership with local community centers and clinics present in the frontier region of southwest Texas (2016 - 2018). Post-trip assessments revealed that students were surprised by the disparities found within the state and gained a better understanding of community need. Subsequently, students revealed the desire to pursue careers that administer care to underserved populations and to improve their Spanish language skills. We concluded that this program increased awareness of cultural competency comparable to study-abroad programs. Post-trip evaluations were helpful in assessing change and impact on the students' cultural and health disparities awareness."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in women's health have existed for decades, despite efforts to strengthen women's reproductive health access and utilization. Recent guidance by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) underscores the often unacknowledged and unmeasured role of racial bias and systemic racial injustice in reproductive health disparities and highlights a renewed commitment to eliminating them. Reaching health equity requires an understanding of current racial-ethnic gaps in reproductive health and a concerted effort to develop and implement strategies to close gaps. We summarized national data for several reproductive health measures, such as contraceptive use, Pap tests, mammograms, maternal mortality, and unintended pregnancies, by race-ethnicity to inform health-equity strategies. Studies were retrieved by systematically searching the PubMed (2010-2020) electronic database to identify most recently published national estimates by race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and non-Hispanic White women). Disparities were found in each reproductive health category. We describe relevant components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, which can help to further strengthen reproductive health care, close gaps in services and outcomes, and decrease racial-ethnic reproductive health disparities. Owing to continued diminishment of certain components of the ACA, to optimally reach reproductive health equity, comprehensive health insurance coverage is vital. Strengthening policy-level strategies, along with ACOG's heightened commitment to eliminating racial disparities in women's health by confronting bias and racism, can strengthen actions toward reproductive health equity."
"As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded across the United States, troubling disparities in mortality have emerged between different racial groups, particularly African Americans and Whites. Media reports, a growing body of COVID-19-related literature, and long-standing knowledge of structural racism and its myriad effects on the African American community provide important lenses for understanding and addressing these disparities.However, troubling gaps in knowledge remain, as does a need to act. Using the best available evidence, we present risk- and place-based recommendations for how to effectively address these disparities in the areas of data collection, COVID-19 exposure and testing, health systems collaboration, human capital repurposing, and scarce resource allocation.Our recommendations are supported by an analysis of relevant bioethical principles and public health practices. Additionally, we provide information on the efforts of Chicago, Illinois' mayoral Racial Equity Rapid Response Team to reduce these disparities in a major urban US setting."
"The advent of direct-acting antiviral agents for treating hepatitis C virus infection has made hepatitis C virus elimination possible. Rural patients with hepatitis C virus infection may be less likely to access direct-acting antiviral agents, but the real-world evidence is scarce on urban-rural disparities in direct-acting antiviral agent utilization.','This retrospective cohort study was conducted in 2019-2020 using Medicare data to examine urban-rural disparities in direct-acting antiviral agent utilization among newly diagnosed patients with hepatitis C virus infection in 2014-2016. Direct-acting antiviral agent use was defined as filling ≥1 prescription for direct-acting antiviral agents during 2014-2017, and patient's urban-rural status was classified on the basis of their ZIP code of residence. This study evaluated the associations between multilevel factors and direct-acting antiviral agent use with a focus on urban-rural disparities. It also assessed changes over time in urban-rural disparities in direct-acting antiviral agent utilization using multivariable cause-specific Cox regression analyses with time-varying hazard ratios.','Among 204,018 new patients with hepatitis C virus infection, about 30% received direct-acting antiviral agents during 2014-2017. Cumulative direct-acting antiviral agent use gradually increased over time in both urban and rural patients. However, the increase was greater in urban patients than in rural patients. In the first year of follow-up, rural patients had a similar rate of receiving direct-acting antiviral agents (adjusted hazard ratio=1.03, 95% CI=1.00, 1.07), but they were less likely to use direct-acting antiviral agents in later years than urban patients (adjusted hazard ratio=0.85, 95% CI=0.81, 0.90 in the second year, adjusted hazard ratio=0.82, 95% CI=0.76, 0.89 in the third year, and adjusted hazard ratio=0.76, 95% CI=0.64, 0.90 in the fourth year of follow-up).','This study reveals important gaps in hepatitis C virus treatment and suggests increasing urban-rural disparities in direct-acting antiviral agent utilization. Enhancing direct-acting antiviral agent uptake in rural populations with hepatitis C virus infection will help reduce hepatitis C virus‒related health disparities and reach the national goal of eliminating hepatitis C virus infection."
"Lesbian, gay, and bisexual-identified (LGB) people experience worse mental and physical health than their straight-identified counterparts. Given remarkable social and legal changes regarding LGB status in recent decades, we theorize that this profound health disadvantage may be changing across cohorts. Using data from the 2013-2018 National Health and Interview Surveys, we analyze five mental and physical health outcomes-psychological distress, depression, anxiety, self-rated physical health, and activity limitation-across three birth cohorts colloquially known as (1) Millennials, (2) Generation Xers, and (3) Baby Boomers and pre-Boomers. We find no evidence of reduced health disparities by sexual orientation across cohorts. Instead, relative to straight-identified respondents, the health disadvantages of gay, lesbian, and-most strikingly-bisexual-identified people have increased across cohorts. Findings highlight the importance of identifying the causes of increased health disparities as well as designing and implementing moredirect public policies and programs to eliminate health disparities among more recent LGB cohorts."
"Health care disparities are an important but sometimes underrepresented topic in graduate medical education. In this study we measured the impact of educational and behavioral interventions on resident knowledge about and attitudes toward health care disparities.','Faculty from 6 residency programs designed and presented an hour-long educational intervention to emphasize the importance of and increase resident knowledge about health care disparities. Selected residents then helped design a month-long behavioral intervention to engage their peers in conversations about disparities with patients. Surveys were administered pre- and post-educational intervention as well as post-behavioral intervention in order to measure the impact each intervention had on resident knowledge and attitudes.','Paired-samples t-tests showed that residents were more knowledgeable about health care disparities issues following didactic teaching (P<0.001) and felt such issues were more important (P<0.001). Furthermore, presence of these feelings significantly predicted the frequency of engaging in the behavioral intervention (r=0.44, P<0.01).','Two brief, simple interventions produced significant changes in resident knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding health care disparities. The educational intervention was most effective at increasing knowledge of disparities in general and encouraging participation in the behavioral intervention, while the behavioral intervention was useful in increasing knowledge of specific patients' barriers to care."
"As the United States' population diversifies, eliminating disparities in health and healthcare has become increasingly important across all disciplines of medicine, including plastic and reconstructive surgery. This is evidenced by the growing body of literature in recent years focusing on disparities in postmastectomy breast reconstruction. No study to date has evaluated whether this research is progressing appropriately to promote tangible evidence-based interventions to reduce these disparities.','A systematic literature review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines was performed to identify studies focusing on disparities in postmastectomy breast reconstruction. A previously established public health framework for advancing health disparities research was used to inform analysis of the quality and progression of the included studies. This triphasic framework categorizes disparities research as follows: detecting (identifies and measures disparities in vulnerable populations), understanding (establishes determinants of disparities), or reducing (proposes and evaluates interventions for eliminating disparities).','Ninety-five studies were identified between 1979 and 2016, with 61 (64.2%) published after 2010. The majority of studies (51.6%) were retrospective cohort or case-control studies (American Society of Plastic Surgery level III evidence). Fifty-eight (63.7%), 31 (34.1%), and 2 (2.2%) studies provided detecting-, understanding- and reducing-phase disparities research, respectively. Non-plastic and reconstructive surgery journals accounted for 70.5% of all articles and for most higher phase research articles, publishing 83.9% and 100% of second and third phase studies, respectively. Disparity categories investigated included race/ethnicity, age, income, insurance status/type, geography, and education level, with race/ethnicity being the most common (73.7%). The most commonly measured outcome was percent of subpopulation receiving reconstruction (63, 66.3%), followed by reconstruction type (14, 16.7%). Patient-, provider-, system-, and research-level factors were all identified as potential targets for interventions to reduce disparities.','Despite a recent increase in literature focusing on postmastectomy breast reconstruction disparities, the majority focuses on identifying vulnerable populations with inadequate progression to second (understanding) and third (reducing) phases. Increasing research funding, availability of language-concordant and culturally concordant educational materials, and advocacy and sociopolitical awareness within the plastic surgery community is necessary to advance research on postmastectomy breast reconstruction and, ultimately, eliminate it."
"Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in cardiovascular care are well-documented. This review aims to highlight the disparities and impact on a group particularly vulnerable to disparities, women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds.','Women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds remain underrepresented in major cardiovascular trials, limiting the generalizability of cardiovascular research to this population. Certain cardiovascular risk factors are more prevalent in women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, including traditional risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Female-specific risk factors including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia as well as non-traditional psychosocial risk factors like depressive and anxiety disorders, increased child care, and familial and home care responsibility have been shown to increase risk for cardiovascular disease events in women more so than in men, and disproportionately affect women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Despite this, minimal interventions to address differential risk have been proposed. Furthermore, disparities in treatment and outcomes that disadvantage minority women persist. The limited improvement in outcomes over time, especially among non-Hispanic Black women, is an area that requires further research and active interventions.','Understanding the lack of representation in cardiovascular trials, differential cardiovascular risk, and disparities in treatment and outcomes among women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds highlights opportunities for improving cardiovascular care among this particularly vulnerable population."
"To determine US diabetes screening estimates in Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Others at the national, regional, and state level.','In this study of 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, we used logistic regression results to generate national, regional, and state screening marginal probabilities (average adjusted predictions (AAPs)) for each race in the two American Diabetes Association recommended screening groups<sup>1</sup>: asymptomatic overweight/obese people <45y with ≥1 diabetes risk factor and<sup>2</sup> people ≥45y.','Even after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, significant racial disparities in screening (p-value<.05) persist at all three geographic levels. Asians had the worst national, regional, and state level AAPs of all the races. Across all races, the Northeast had the highest regional screening levels (regional AAP: 48.4-78.58%) while the West had the lowest (regional AAP: 41.98-75.18%).','Study findings indicate that sociodemographic and clinical factors do not fully explain racial disparities in diabetes screening. Further research on clinician and patient attitudes towards diabetes screening are warranted in order to design and implement initiatives in US areas where certain racial groups have particularly low diabetes screening levels."
"<b>Objective:</b> The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in women is higher than men. However, the knowledge of gender disparity in ADRD treatment is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the gender disparities in the receipt of anti-dementia medications among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD in the U.S. <b>Methods:</b> We used data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey 2016. Anti-dementia medications included cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs; including rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (including memantine). Descriptive analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were implemented to determine the possible gender disparities in the receipt of anti-dementia medications. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify gender disparities among beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and those with only AD-related dementias. <b>Results:</b> Descriptive analyses showed there were statistically significant differences in age, marital status, and Charlson comorbidities index (CCI) between Medicare beneficiaries who received and who did not receive anti-dementia medications. After controlling for covariates, we found that female Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD were 1.7 times more likely to receive anti-dementia medications compared to their male counterparts (odds ratio [OR]: 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-2.45). Specifically, among Medicare beneficiaries with AD, females were 1.2 times more likely to receive anti-dementia medications (Odds Radio: 1.20; 95% confidence interval: 0.58-2.47), and among the Medicare beneficiaries with only AD-related dementias, females were 1.9 times more likely to receive anti-dementia medications (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.23-2.95). <b>Conclusion:</b> Healthcare providers should be aware of gender disparities in receiving anti-dementia medications among patients with ADRD, and the need to plan programs of care to support both women and men. Future approaches to finding barriers of prescribing, receiving and, adhering to anti-dementia medications by gender should include differences in longevity, biology, cognition, social roles, and environment."
"This study investigates race-related disparities in sleep duration and quality among diverse young adults during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.','Online cross-sectional study of young adults in the United States in April 2020.','About 547 American Indian/Alaskan Native (AIAN), Asian, Black, Latinx, and White young adults ages 18-25 years.','Participants completed measures of sleep duration and quality, coronavirus victimization distress, depression, age, sex/gender, employment status, essential worker status, student status, residential region, socioeconomic status, concerns about contracting coronavirus and CDC health risks.','Black young adults reported the largest disparity in sleep duration and quality. For sleep duration, AIAN, Asian, White, and Latinx young adults reported approximately one additional hour of sleep compared to Black respondents. Mediation analyses suggest that disparities in sleep duration between Asian and Black young adults may be explained by the higher likelihood of Black respondents being essential workers. For sleep quality, Latinx, White, AIAN, and Asian young adults reported higher levels than Black respondents. Including coronavirus victimization distress as an intervening pathway decreased the effect for Asian and White respondents on sleep quality, suggesting that coronavirus victimization distress partially explains Black and Asian, as well as Black and White differences in sleep quality.','Black young adults reported the shortest sleep duration and lowest levels of sleep quality relative to AIAN, Asian, Latinx and White peers. Interpersonal experiences of coronavirus victimization and structural inequities may partially explain disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Health disparities between American men of African and European descent (AA and EA, respectively) can be attributed to multiple factors, including disparities in socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, lifestyle, ancestry, and molecular aberrations. Numerous clinical trials and research studies are being performed to identify new and better therapeutic approaches to detect and treat prostate cancer. Of potential concern is the fact that the majority of the patients enrolled on these trials are EA. This disproportionate enrollment of EA could have implications when disease management recommendations are proposed without regard to the existing disparities in prostate cancer between races. With increasing advancements in immunotherapies, the immunological disparities between men of diverse ethnicities will need to be fully explored to develop novel and effective therapeutic approaches for prostate cancer patients globally. To help address this need, this review fully describes inequalities in prostate cancer at the immunological level between AA and EA."
"This study aimed to investigate racial/ethnic disparities in emotional distress during witnessed police stops among a national sample of urban-born youth.','A national sample of urban-born youth in the U.S. from the most recent wave (2014-2017) of the Fragile Families & Child Wellbeing Study was used in the present study, with a particular focus on youth who report having witnessed police stops, despite not being directly stopped by the police (N = 1,488).','Significant racial/ethnic disparities in feeling angry and unsafe during witnessed police stops emerged, with multiracial, black, and Hispanic youth exhibiting the highest rates of these forms of emotional distress. In the case of Black and multiracial youth, officer intrusiveness and perceptions of procedural injustice collectively explain a large portion of disparities in emotional distress during witnessed stops.','Youth of color are more likely to report emotional distress during witnessed police stops, largely due to the officer intrusiveness and perceived injustices that characterize these stops. Moving forward, scholars should consider whether racial/ethnic disparities in witnessing police violence and injustice may be a significant driver of mental health inequities among urban-born youth."
"Overall, foreign-born women are less likely than U.S.-born women to have initiated human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. However, foreign-born women are a racially/ethnically diverse population, and race/ethnicity is an independent predictor of HPV vaccination.','Using 2011-2015 National Health Interview Survey data, we used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for foreign-born black, Latina, and Asian women compared to foreign-born white women and U.S.-born white women, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. We added socioeconomic factors followed by health care access indicators, which we conceptualized as potential mediators, to each model to assess whether they helped explain observed disparities.','Foreign-born Asian ([odds ratio=] 0.43; [95% confidence interval:] 0.29-0.65) and Latina (0.46; 0.32-0.68) women had significantly lower adjusted odds of initiating HPV vaccination compared to foreign-born white women. Foreign-born white (0.64; 0.45-0.90), black (0.44; 0.29, 0.67), Latina (0.29; 0.24-0.35), and Asian (0.28; 0.21-0.38) women had significantly lower adjusted odds of HPV vaccination initiation compared to U.S.-born white women. Socioeconomic factors only explained HPV vaccination initiation disparities between foreign-born Latina women and foreign-born and U.S.-born white women. Health care access indicators modestly explained disparities between foreign-born white, black, and Latina women and U.S.-born white women only.','We observed pronounced HPV vaccination initiation disparities among foreign-born women in relation to race/ethnicity and between foreign-born women from minoritized racial/ethnic backgrounds and U.S.-born white women. Research on nativity disparities in HPV vaccination should take into account race/ethnicity, and vice versa. Interventions that seek to facilitate HPV vaccination among foreign-born women are needed and should address the unique needs of those from minoritized racial/ethnic backgrounds to promote cancer equity."
"To improve the cardiovascular health of those with socioeconomic disadvantages, the nature of their disparities must be explored to inform targeted interventions for this group. However, these efforts have been scarce in all areas of nursing research and practice in South Korea.','This systematic review aims to examine the nature of socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular health in South Korea.','Multiple electronic databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane (2009-2019.06) were searched. A total of 42 articles published in English or Korean that examined socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular health in South Korea were selected, reviewed, and analyzed using a narrative synthesis.','Socioeconomic disparities existed in cardiovascular health among Korean populations across the disease continuum from risk factors to mortality. The magnitudes, directions, and significance of the observed associations between socioeconomic status and cardiovascular health varied by socioeconomic status indicators, gender, and age groups. Five studies (12%) explained the mediation and moderation of multiple factors to the associations.','This body of knowledge will serve as a basis to inform strategies, interventions, or policies to reduce disparities in cardiovascular health."
"In the USA, race and socioeconomic status are well-known factors associated with colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates. These are higher among blacks than whites and other racial/ethnic groups.','In this article, we review opportunities to address disparities in colorectal cancer incidence, mortality, and survivorship among African Americans.','First, we summarize the primary prevention of colorectal cancer and recent advances in the early detection of the disease and disparities in screening. Then, we consider black-white disparities in colorectal cancer treatment and survival including factors that may contribute to such disparities and the important roles played by cultural competency, patient trust in one's physician, and health literacy in addressing colorectal cancer disparities, including the need for studies involving the use of colorectal cancer patient navigators who are culturally competent.','To reduce these disparities, intervention efforts should focus on providing high-quality screening and treatment for colorectal cancer and on educating African Americans about the value of diet, weight control, screening, and treatment. Organized approaches for delivering colorectal cancer screening should be accompanied by programs and policies that provide access to diagnostic follow-up and treatment for underserved populations."
"In 2017, preliminary data show that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 67% of new diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, that MSM who inject drugs accounted for an additional 3%, and that African American/black (black) and Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) MSM were disproportionately affected (1). During 2010-2015, racial/ethnic disparities in HIV incidence increased among MSM; in 2015, rates among black and Hispanic MSM were 10.5 and 4.9 times as high, respectively, as the rate among white MSM (compared with 9.2 and 3.8 times as high, respectively, in 2010) (2). Increased use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which reduces the risk for sexual acquisition of HIV infection by approximately 99% when taken daily as prescribed,* would help to reduce these disparities and support the Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America initiative<sup>†</sup> (3). Although PrEP use has increased among all MSM since 2014 (4), racial/ethnic disparities in PrEP use could increase existing disparities in HIV incidence among MSM (5). To understand racial/ethnic disparities in PrEP awareness, discussion with a health care provider, and use (steps in the HIV PrEP continuum of care) (6), CDC analyzed 2017 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data. Black and Hispanic MSM were significantly less likely than were white MSM to be aware of PrEP, to have discussed PrEP with a health care provider, or to have used PrEP within the past year. Among those who had discussed PrEP with a health care provider within the past year, 68% of white MSM, 62% of Hispanic MSM, and 55% of black MSM, reported PrEP use. Prevention efforts need to increase PrEP use among all MSM and target eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in PrEP use.<sup>§</sup>."
"Cancer health care disparities are complex, involve patient, clinician and health care system factors, and are defined as adverse differences in cancer outcomes. This analysis describes NCI's Healthcare Delivery Research Program's (HDRP) portfolio of disparities-focused research and identifies future research opportunities. Grants through HDRP (fiscal years 2012 to 2016) focused on detecting, understanding, and/or intervening on disparities in or among health disparity populations were reviewed by co-authors. Forty-eight funded grants were identified, coded, and characterized. Descriptive analyses are reported. Most studies focused on racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers were most frequently examined. Almost 40% of studies addressed the intervening phase of the disparities research continuum. Few studies focused on clinician-level factors or involved the community in the research design. A sustained disparities research emphasis is essential to addressing the determinants of and cancer burden among health disparity populations across the cancer care continuum."
"Heart disease is not only the leading cause of death in the U.S. but also the main contributor to racial disparities in life expectancy. Despite this, heart disease mortality rates and racial disparities in these rates are not readily available at the city level where they can be the most quickly and effectively addressed. We calculated age-adjusted heart disease mortality rates and corresponding racial rate ratios (RRs) and rate differences (RDs) for the non-Hispanic Black (Black) and non-Hispanic White (White) populations for the years 1990-1994 and 2005-2009 for the U.S. and the 50 largest cities therein. We then examined relationships between the disparities and city-level population indicators. Nationally, mortality rates were significantly higher among Blacks than Whites at both time periods. Larger improvements in rates for Whites compared to Blacks resulted in a significant increase in disparities over the 20-year period for 11 cities. There were 19,448 excess Black deaths in the U.S. annually. City-level income inequality, as well as the overall city and White median household income, contributed to these disparities. By identifying city-specific disparities and trends, health care providers, public health agencies, and researchers can target the areas with the most need and can look at cities without disparities for clues on how to best advance health equity in heart disease morbidity and mortality."
"The drivers of trauma disparities are multiple and complex; yet, understanding the causes will direct needed interventions. The aims of this article are to (1) explore how the injured patient, his or her social environment, and the health care system interact to contribute to trauma disparities and examine the evidence in support of interventions and (2) develop a conceptual framework that captures the socioecological context of trauma disparities. Using a scoping review methodology, articles were identified through PubMed and CINAHL between 2000 and 2015. Data were extracted on the patient population, social determinants of health, and interventions targeting trauma disparities and violence. Based on the scoping review of 663 relevant articles, we inductively developed a conceptual model, The Social Determinants of Trauma: A Trauma Disparities Framework, based on the categorization of articles by: institutional power (n = 9), social context-place (n = 117), discrimination experiences (n = 59), behaviors and comorbidities (n = 57), disparities research (n = 18), and trauma outcomes (n = 85). Intervention groupings included social services investment (n = 54), patient factors (n = 88), hospital factors (n = 27), workforce factors (n = 31), and performance improvement (n = 118). This scoping review produced a needed taxonomy scheme of the drivers of trauma disparities and known interventions that in turn informed the development of The Social Determinants of Trauma: A Trauma Disparities Framework. This study adds to the trauma disparities literature by establishing social context as a key contributor to disparities in trauma outcomes and provides a road map for future trauma disparities research."
"Lack of health equity ultimately leads to unequal treatment of diverse patients and contributes to the growing disparities seen in national health. Academic medical centers should consider providing health care providers and biomedical researchers training on how to identify and address health disparities.','The authors led an introductory health disparities course for graduate students and research and clinical fellows at an academic medical center in the Midwest. We compared pre/postcourse assessments to determine changes in learners' perceptions and knowledge of health disparities using an unpaired analysis to permit inclusion of responses provided only at baseline.','Sixty-two learners completed preassessment, with 56 completing the postassessment (90%). In the postcourse assessment, learners reported an increase in knowledge of disparities and had changes in their perceptions of health disparities linked to treatment of different patient groups based on demographic characteristics. There was a statistically significant difference in learners' perceptions of how patients are treated based on gender identity (<i>P</i>=0.02) and sexual orientation (<i>P</i>=0.04).','The results detail how an academic medical center can provide training on health disparities for diverse learners. This study underscores the influence of health disparities from the perspective of learners who conduct biomedical research and patient care. This course serves a model for introductory-level health disparities courses."
"Integrase inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended by expert panels as initial therapy for people with HIV. Because there can be disparities in prescribing and uptake of novel and/or recommended therapies, this analysis assessed potential INSTI prescribing disparities using a combined data set from the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort and the DC Cohort. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with ever being prescribed an INSTI. Disparities were noted, including clinic location, age, and being transgender. Identifying disparities may allow clinicians to focus their attention on these individuals and ensure that therapy decisions are grounded in valid clinical reasons."
"Human papilloma virus testing for oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma has been recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network since 2012. We examine disparities, reported rates of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, and the impact on these findings of limitations with the variable in database registries.','The HPV variable was queried for patients with oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma (OPSCC) from 2013 to 2016 in National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER). Multivariable regression was used to identify disparities based on sociodemographic variables. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate limitations of the variable.','Despite limitations in the HPV variable in the databases, there was less than 100% adherence to recommended testing, and there were significant disparities in multiple sociodemographic variables. For example, in NCDB 70% of white versus 60.4% of black patients were tested (odds ratio [OR] 0.75, confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.85, p ≤ 0.0001); in SEER 59.8% of white and 47.6% of black patients were tested (OR 0.73, CI 0.67-0.81; p ≤ 0.0001).','Disparities exist among patients undergoing testing for HPV-associated OPSCC and adherence to guideline recommended HPV testing has been suboptimal. In addition, the HPV variable definition, especially as it relates to p16 positivity, and use in these two registries should be improved."
"Disparities in survival by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and geography in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors have not been well studied.','A retrospective cohort study utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was conducted for AYA patients diagnosed with primary CNS tumors. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were calculated using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate the association between race/ethnicity, SES, rurality, and hazard of death.','All minority groups showed an increased hazard of death with greatest disparities in the high-grade glioma cohort. Lower SES was associated with an increased hazard of death in non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients (aHR 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.24), non-Hispanic Black (NHB) patients (aHR 1.34; 95% CI 1.00-1.80), and patients aged 25-29 years (aHR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.55). Mediation analysis showed an indirect effect of SES on the effect of race/ethnicity on the hazard of death only among NHB patients, with SES accounting for 33.7% of the association between NHB and hazard of death. Rurality was associated with an increased hazard of death for patients in the lowest SES tertile (aHR 1.31; 95% CI 1.08-1.59) and NHW patients (aHR 1.20; 95% CI 1.08-1.34).','Patients identified as a racial/ethnic minority, patients with a lower SES, and patients residing in rural areas had an increased hazard of death. Further studies are needed to understand and address the biological, psychosocial, societal, and economic factors that impact AYA neuro-oncology patients at highest risk of experiencing poorer outcomes."
"Concussion is common and subspecialty care can be essential to ensure recovery. However, barriers may exist to accessing care. This study aimed to assess disparities in subspecialty concussion care related to ethnicity, limited English proficiency (LEP), and insurance status. We utilized logistic regression to analyze 2010-2015 administrative data from four Sports Medicine clinics, comparing odds of being seen for concussion to odds of being seen for fracture by ethnicity, insurance type, and interpreter usage, controlling for demographic factors. ICD-9 codes were used to identify concussion and fracture. Our final sample contained 25,294 subjects: 5621 with concussion and 19,673 with fracture. In bivariate analysis, youth seen for concussion had 83% lower odds of being Hispanic compared with youth seen for fracture (95%CI: 75-92%). Due to interactions between ethnicity and interpreter use, we utilized a stratified multivariate model as our final model. Youth with concussion had 1.8× greater odds of having private insurance compared with youth with fracture (Hispanic OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.3; Non-Hispanic OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-2.0). Youth with concussion also had greater odds of not using an interpreter, though the strength of this association was weaker for Hispanic youth compared with non-Hispanic youth (Hispanic OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.30-2.17; Non-Hispanic OR 4.36, 95% CI 3.00-6.35). Age and sex were included as covariates. In conclusion, our analysis suggests disparities in subspecialty concussion care for Hispanic youth, as well as for individuals with LEP and non-private insurance. Further research should explore means for improving access to concussion care for all youth."
"Israel's unique population is comprised of two main ethnic groups-Jews (75%) and Arabs (21%), with differing socioeconomic, cultural, and genetic profiles. This study's objective was to evaluate disparities in the incidence, presentation, and outcomes of gynecologic cancers among Israeli women of Arab and Jewish ethnicity.','Data on the Israeli female population diagnosed with gynecologic cancers during the years 2000-2012 was obtained from the National Cancer Registry and the National Population Registry. Disease incidence rates by ethnic origin were calculated, and the ""Segi World standard population"" was used for age standardization. Data for Jewish and Arab patients was compared using chi-square test for categorical variables and T test for continuous variables. Survival outcomes were compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards modeling.','Annual ASR (age-standardized rate) for ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancers, are all significantly higher among Israeli women of Jewish ethnicity. Israeli Arab women are diagnosed with cervical cancer at an older age (mean, 60.9 vs 55.9, p < 0.001). Stage distribution for uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancers is similar in both ethnic groups. The age-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality from uterine cancer is significantly lower among Jewish Israeli women compared to Arab Israeli women (HR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.57-0.78, p < 0.0001). During the study period, there was a significant decline in the ASR for ovarian cancer among Jewish Israeli women. The ASR for pre-invasive cervical disease increased significantly in both ethnic groups.','Disparities in gynecological cancer rates, presentations, and outcomes are evident between two major ethnic groups in Israel. Lower cancer incidence rates among Israeli Arab women are likely multifactorial. Uterine cancer outcomes between the two ethnic groups need to be further assessed in order to identify opportunities for improved outcomes among Israeli Arab women."
"Advances in genomic medicine are arising from efforts to build a national learning healthcare system (LHS) and large-scale precision medicine studies. However, the underlying evidence base lacks sufficient data from populations historically underrepresented in biomedical research. Although the literature on health and healthcare disparities is extensive, disparities in the availability and quality of health information about diverse and underrepresented populations are less well characterized. This Perspective describes scientific and ethical benefits to incorporating health information from diverse and underrepresented populations in the LHS, resulting in a more robust and generalizable LHS. Near-term recommendations for incorporating diversity into the evidence base for genomic medicine are proposed, even as the groundwork for national and international efforts is underway."
"Obstetric care in the US is complicated by marked racial and ethnic disparities in maternal obstetric outcomes, including severe morbidity and mortality, which are not explained by underlying differences in patient characteristics. Understanding differences in care delivery related to clinical acuity across different racial groups may help elucidate the source of these disparities.','This study examined the association of maternal race with utilization of critical care interventions.','This is a retrospective cohort study conducted as a secondary analysis of a large, multicenter observational study of women undergoing cesarean delivery. All women with a known delivery date were included. The primary outcome measure, a composite of critical care interventions (CCI) at delivery or postpartum that included mechanical ventilation, central and arterial line placement, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were compared by racial/ethnic group-non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American. We evaluated differences in utilization of critical care with a multivariable regression model accounting for selected characteristics present at admission for delivery, including maternal age, BMI, co-morbidities, parity, and plurality. Maternal mortality was also evaluated as a secondary outcome and the frequency of CCI by significant maternal co-morbidity, specifically heart disease, renal disease, and chronic hypertension was assessed to ascertain the level of care provided to women of different race/ethnicity with specific baseline co-morbidities.','73,096 of 73,257 women in the parent trial met inclusion criteria, of whom 505 (0.7%) received a CCI and 3337 (4.6%) had a significant medical co-morbidity (1.2% heart disease, 0.8% renal disease, 2.5% chronic hypertension). The mortality rate was significantly higher among non-Hispanic black women, compared to non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women. In the adjusted model, there was no significant association between CCI and race/ethnicity.','This study suggests that differences in maternal morbidity by race may be accounted for by differential escalation to higher intensity care. Further investigation into processes for care intensification may continue to clarify sources of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and potential for improvement."
"Improving the prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer is a priority for reducing rural-urban disparities in colorectal cancer mortality. By eliminating out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for preventive colonoscopies, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could have reduced rural-urban disparities in screening.','We used the Maine Health Data Organization All-Payer Claims Database including all commercially-insured and Medicare beneficiaries aged 50-75 between 2009 and 2012. Rural-urban commuting areas were used to classify rural/urban residence. ICD-9 and CPT codes identified colonoscopies. We summed all OOP payments per patient-day. An interrupted time series model estimated the impact of the ACA on trends in rural-urban disparities in colonoscopy rates and OOP costs.','Before the ACA, colonoscopy rates were 16% lower in rural than urban areas (5.1% vs. 6.1% of enrollees annually) and median OOP costs were nearly double ($195 vs. $98). The ACA reduced median OOP payments by $94 (p = .001) initially and $4 monthly (p = .038) in rural areas, and $63 (p < .001) in urban areas. The rural-urban gap in OOP payments dropped by $4 monthly (p = .007). The ACA also reduced rural-urban disparities in colonoscopy rates (disparity decrease of 0.005 (6%) monthly, p < .001). The rural-urban gap in colonoscopy rates declined 40% relative to the pre-ACA period by December 2012.','The ACA was associated with significant reductions in rural-urban disparities in colonoscopies in Maine, suggesting that OOP costs are an important barrier for rural residents. Further research is needed to determine whether increased uptake, particularly in rural areas, translated into better patient outcomes for colorectal cancer."
"To examine whether interpersonal aspects of patient-clinician interactions, such as patient-perceived medical discrimination, clinician mistrust, and treatment decision-making contribute to racial/ethnic/educational disparities in breast cancer care.','A telephone interview was administered to 542 Asian/Pacific Islander (API), Black, Hispanic, and White women identified through the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, ages 20 and older diagnosed with a first primary invasive breast cancer. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from logistic regression models that assessed associations between race/ethnicity/education, medical discrimination, clinician mistrust, and treatment decision-making with concordance to breast cancer treatment guidelines (guideline-concordant treatment) and perceived quality of care (pQoC).','Approximately three-quarters of women received treatment that was guideline-concordant (76.6%) and reported that their breast cancer care was excellent (72.1%). Non-college-educated Black women had lower odds of guideline-concordant care (aOR (CI) = 0.29 (0.12-0.67)) vs. college-educated White women. Odds of excellent pQoC were lower among the following: college-educated Hispanic women (aOR (CI) = 0.09 (0.02-0.47)) and API women regardless of education (aORs ≤ 0.50) vs. college-educated White women, women reporting low and moderate levels of discrimination (aORs ≤ 0.44) vs. none, and women reporting any clinician mistrust (aOR (CI) = 0.50 (0.29-0.88)) vs. none. Disparities in guideline-concordant care and pQoC persisted after controlling for medical discrimination, clinician mistrust, and decision-making.','Interpersonal aspects of the patient-clinician interaction had an impact on pQoC but not receipt of guideline-concordant treatment and did not explain disparities in either outcome.','Although breast cancer survivors' interpersonal interactions with clinicians did not influence receipt of appropriate treatment, intervention strategies to improve patient-clinician relations may help attenuate disparities in survivors' pQoC."
"Health disparities have a major impact in the quality of life and clinical care received by minorities in the United States. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare cardiopulmonary disorder that affects children and adults and that, if untreated, results in premature death. The impact of health disparities in the diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcome of patients with PAH has not been systematically investigated.','The specific goals of this research statement were to conduct a critical review of the literature concerning health disparities in PAH, identify major research gaps and prioritize direction for future research.','Literature searches from multiple reference databases were performed using medical subject headings and text words for pulmonary hypertension and health disparities. Members of the committee discussed the evidence and provided recommendations for future research.','Few studies were found discussing the impact of health disparities in PAH. Using recent research statements focused on health disparities, the group identified six major study topics that would help address the contribution of health disparities to PAH. Representative studies in each topic were discussed and specific recommendations were made by the group concerning the most urgent questions to address in future research studies.','At present, there are few studies that address health disparities in PAH. Given the potential adverse impact of health disparities, we recommend that research efforts be undertaken to address the topics discussed in the document. Awareness of health disparities will likely improve advocacy efforts, public health policy and the quality of care of vulnerable populations with PAH."
"Participation in extracurricular activities and community involvement during secondary school is important for the healthy social, emotional, mental, and physical development of adolescents, especially those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study utilized three waves of data (2016, 2017, and 2018) from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) to examine disparities in extracurricular participation among 12- to 17-year old adolescents with ASD. Across the three waves, data demonstrate clear sociodemographic disparities among adolescents with ASD. These disparities were more evident in adolescents with caregivers that had less education and lower household income, as well as males. These disparities suggest a continued need for targeted interventions to promote engagement among adolescents with ASD to narrow this social disparity gap."
"Disparities are prevalent in numerous areas of healthcare. We sought to investigate whether there were racial/ethnic disparities among pregnant women with the most severe form of alloimmunization who require intrauterine transfusions (IUT). We reviewed patients who underwent IUT for alloimmunization at a single fetal treatment center between 2015 and 2020. This ""IUT cohort"" was compared to an ""Alloimmunization cohort"": patients seen at our institution with a diagnosis of alloimmunization during pregnancy, who did not receive IUT. We collected maternal demographics including self-identified race/ethnicity and primary language, transfusion, and antibody characteristics. The cohorts were compared using unpaired t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and Fischer's exact tests, as appropriate. The IUT cohort included 43 patients and the alloimmunization cohort included 1049 patients. Compared to the alloimmunization cohort, there were significantly more patients of Latina descent in the IUT cohort (23.3% vs. 3.4%, p < .0001), and more non-English speakers (18.6% vs. 4.6%, p = .001). Twenty-one percent (9/43) of patients had immigrated to the United States, all of whom had pregnancies or miscarriages in their country of origin. A third of patients had new antibodies identified on serial screens during the current pregnancy. Significantly more women of Latina ethnicity and non-English speakers required IUTs compared to the cohort of women with alloimmunization. Insufficient access to care prior to arriving in the United States and among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States may contribute to these findings. Providers should be cognizant of potential, racial, and ethnic inequalities among women receiving intrauterine transfusions."
"For a comprehensive understanding of high-level obesity in the USA, we studied the trends of obesity prevalence since 2007, and related biological, behavioral, and sociocultural factors in obesity racial/ethnic disparities. We searched PubMed, Embase, and national data archives for the studies using national survey data and published in English from January 1, 2007 to September 11, 2020. Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were systematically reviewed. After a short leveling-off during 2009-2012, the US national prevalence of obesity has steadily increased. Although women had higher racial/ethnic disparities in obesity and severe obesity than men, it decreased due to the significant drop in non-Hispanic black (NHB) women in the last 10 y. However, obesity and severe obesity prevalence increased in Mexican-American (MA) men, MA boys, and MA girls and became similar to or surpassing NHB groups. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities remained in the past decade. Even at the same level of BMI, MAs and non-Hispanic Asians had a higher percent of body fat and metabolic syndrome than other ethnic/racial groups. NHB's cultural preference for a large body significantly associated weight misperception and lower weight control practices. In addition to socioeconomic status, health behaviors, neighborhood environments, and early childhood health factors explained substantial racial/ethnic differences in obesity. Differences in biological, behavioral, and sociocultural characteristics should be considered in future public health intervention efforts to combat obesity in the USA."
"Racial and socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer mortality persist. In Boston, MA, Black, Non-Hispanic women and Medicaid-insured individuals are 2-3 times more likely to have delays in treatment compared to White or privately insured women. While evidence-based care coordination strategies for reducing delays exist, they are not systematically implemented across healthcare settings.','Translating Research Into Practice (TRIP) utilizes community engaged research methods to address breast cancer care delivery disparities. Four Massachusetts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) hubs collaborated with the Boston Breast Cancer Equity Coalition (The Coalition) to implement an evidence-based care coordination intervention for Boston residents at risk for delays in breast cancer care. The Coalition used a community-driven process to define the problem of care delivery disparities, identify the target population, and develop a rigorous pragmatic approach. We chose a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study design. The intervention implements three evidence-based strategies: patient navigation services, a shared patient registry for use across academic medical centers, and a web-based social determinants of health platform to identify and address barriers to care. Primary clinical outcomes include time to first treatment and receipt of guideline-concordant treatment, which are captured through electronic health records abstraction. We will use mixed methods to collect the secondary implementation outcomes of acceptability, adoption/penetration, fidelity, sustainability and cost.','TRIP utilizes an innovative community-driven research strategy, focused on interdisciplinary collaborations, to design and implement a translational science study that aims to more efficiently integrate proven health services interventions into clinical practice."
"Patient-clinician communication (PCC) may generate or reduce healthcare disparities. This paper is based on the 2017 International Conference on Communication in Healthcare keynote address and reviews PCC literature as a research area for the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD).','A narrative review of selected evidence on disparities in PCC experienced by race and ethnic minorities, associations between PCC and poor health outcomes, and patient and clinician factors related to PCC.','Factors associated with poor quality PCC on the patient level include being a member of racial/ethnic minority, having limited English proficiency, and low health and digital literacy; on the clinician level, being less culturally competent, lacking communication skills to facilitate shared decision-making, and holding unconscious biases. Recommendations include offering patient- and/or clinician-targeted interventions to guard against unconscious biases and improve PCC, screening patients for health literacy and English proficiency, integrating PCC in performance processes, and leveraging health information technologies to address unconscious biases.','EffectivePCC is a pathway to decrease health disparities and promote health equity.','Standardized collection of social determinants of health in the Electronic Health Record is an importantfirst step in promoting more effective PCC."
"People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) with more severe impairments often face service disparities. The aim of this study was to explore not only disparities in quality of life outcomes for people with IDD with severe impairments, but also disparities in the supports they receive from disability service organizations. Our analysis of Personal Outcome Measures interviews from 1,300 people revealed people with severe impairments experienced quality of life disparities in most domains, attributed to the fact that they also received fewer organizational supports than people with less severe impairments. By paying attention to person-centered outcomes, including these disparities, organizations' roles can shift from just providing services to supporting people to achieve the outcomes that are truly important to them."
"Understanding and addressing health inequities calls for enhanced theoretical and empirical attention to multiple forms of stigma and its influence on health behaviors and health outcomes within marginalized communities. While recent scholarship highlights the role of structural stigma on between-group health disparities, the extant literature has yet to elucidate the mechanisms through which structural stigma gives rise to within-group health disparities. In this article, we review and use relevant literature to inform the development of a conceptual model outlining how structural stigma contributes to within-group health disparities by creating division and tension within communities marginalized due to their social statuses and identities. We specifically focus on disparities among (1) communities of color due to White supremacy, (2) gender and sexual minority communities due to patriarchy and heterosexism, and (3) the disability community due to ableism. We argue that the nature and extent of the stigma members of stigmatized communities face are intricately tied to how visible the stigmatized characteristic is to others. By visibility, we refer to characteristics that are more easily perceived by others, and reveal a person's social identity (e.g., race/ethnicity, nativity, relationship status, gender expression, and disability status). This paper advances the literature by discussing the implications of the model for future research, practice, and policy, including the importance of acknowledging the ways in which structural stigma intentionally disrupts the collective identity and solidarity of communities and consequently threatens health equity."
"Gender and sexual minority individuals face considerable physical and mental health disparities, health risk factors, and barriers to care. These disparities are rooted in systemic and interpersonal prejudice, discrimination, and violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other (LGBTQ+) individuals and communities that place LGBTQ+ individuals at increased risk for negative social determinants of health. While also advocating for systemic change, individual providers and clinics have an ethical duty to promote an openly affirming, culturally competent health care environment that can help to address these disparities on an individual patient level."
"In an era of the COVID-19 pandemic, improving health outcomes for diverse rural communities requires collective and sustained actions across transdisciplinary researchers, intersectoral partners, multilevel government action, and authentic engagement with those who carry the burden-rural communities.','Drawing from an analysis of transcriptions and documents from a national workshop on the ""State of Rural Health Disparities: Research Gaps and Recommendations,"" this brief report underscores the gaps and priorities for future strategies for tackling persistent rural health inequities.','Four overarching recommendations were provided by national thought leaders in rural health: (1) create mechanisms to allow the rural research community time to build sustainable community-based participatory relationships; (2) support innovative research designs and approaches relevant to rural settings; (3) sustain effective interventions relevant to unique challenges in rural areas; and (4) recognize and identify the diversity within and across rural populations and adapt culturally and language-appropriate approaches.','The COVID-19 public health crisis has exacerbated disparities for rural communities and underscored the need for diverse community-centered approaches in health research and dedicated funding to rural service agencies and populations."
"This paper provides the first review of empirical studies of segregation and black-white cancer disparities.','We searched all years of PubMed (through May 2016) using these terms: racial segregation, residential segregation, neighborhood racial composition (first terms) and (second terms) cancer incidence, mortality, survival, stage at diagnosis, screening. The 17 (of 668) articles that measured both segregation and a cancer outcome were retained.','Segregation contributed significantly to cancer and to racial cancer disparities in 70% of analyses, even after controlling for socioeconomic status and health insurance. Residing in segregated African-American areas was associated with higher odds of later-stage diagnosis of breast and lung cancers, higher mortality rates and lower survival rates from breast and lung cancers, and higher cumulative cancer risks associated with exposure to ambient air toxics. There were no studies of many types of cancer (e.g., cervical). Studies differed in their measure of segregation, and 40% used an invalid measure. Possible mediators of the segregation effect usually were not tested.','Empirical analysis of segregation and racial cancer disparities is a recent area of research. The literature is limited to 17 studies that focused primarily on breast cancer. Studies differed in their measure of segregation, yet segregation nonetheless contributed to cancer and to racial cancer disparities in 70% of analyses. This suggests the need for further research that uses valid measures of segregation, examines a variety of types of cancers, and explores the variables that may mediate the segregation effect."
"Cancer end-of-life care and associated racial-ethnic disparities have been in focus during the last few years due to concerns regarding subjective care variations and poor quality of care. Given the high mortality rate and disease burden of lung cancer, end-of-life care quality is particularly crucial for this disease. This study uses previously validated measures and examines racial-ethnic disparities in lung cancer end-of-life care quality.','This study involves retrospective analysis of patients ≥66 years, who were diagnosed with stage I-IV lung cancer, and who died on or before December 31, 2013, using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result-Medicare data from 1991-2013. Poor quality of care was measured using three themes: (1) potentially preventable medical encounters, (2) delayed hospice referral, and (3) aggressive chemotherapy provision during end-of-life. The patients were analyzed as two separate cohorts of NSCLC and SCLC patients. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate racial-ethnic disparities in the adjusted odds of receiving poor quality end-of-life care.','The study found considerable racial-ethnic disparities in end-of-life care quality. The racial-ethnic minorities had higher odds of experiencing potentially preventable medical encounters in the last month of life as compared with non-Hispanic whites. Odds of delayed hospice referral and aggressive chemotherapy provision during end-of-life were lower in non-Hispanic blacks as compared with non-Hispanic whites.','The study findings highlight the continued lack of access and care disparity among the minorities, which could precipitate potentially preventable utilizations, and limit access to hospice care during end-of-life. The study suggests the need to develop educational, patient navigational and other interventions that could potentially reduce aggressive utilizations and improve appropriate hospice care provision during end-of-life."
"Knowledge of geographical disparities in myocardial infarction (MI) is critical for guiding health planning and resource allocation. The objectives of this study were to identify geographic disparities in MI hospitalization risks in Florida and assess temporal changes in these disparities between 2005 and 2014. This study used retrospective data on MI hospitalizations that occurred among Florida residents between 2005 and 2014. We identified spatial clusters of hospitalization risks using Kulldorff's circular and Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics. Counties with persistently high or low MI hospitalization risks were identified. There was a 20% decline in hospitalization risks during the study period. However, we found persistent clustering of high risks in the Big Bend region, South Central and southeast Florida, and persistent clustering of low risks primarily in the South. Risks decreased by 7%-21% in high-risk clusters and by 9%-28% in low-risk clusters. The risk decreased in the high-risk cluster in the southeast but increased in the Big Bend area during the last four years of the study. Overall, risks in low-risk clusters were ahead those for high-risk clusters by at least 10 years. Despite MI risk declining over the study period, disparities in MI risks persist. Eliminating/reducing those disparities will require prioritizing high-risk clusters for interventions."
"Several studies have indicated that racial disparities may exist in the management and outcomes of acute trauma care. One segment of trauma care that has not been as extensively investigated, however, is that of cranial trauma care. The goal of this study was to determine whether significant differences exist among racial and ethnic groups in various measures of inpatient management and outcomes after gunshot wounds to the head (GWH).','In this study, the authors used the Nationwide (National) Inpatient Sample (NIS) to investigate all-cause mortality, receipt of surgery, days from admission to initial intervention, discharge disposition, length of hospital stay, and total hospital charges of those with GWH from 2012 to 2016. A 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of race on these endpoints, while controlling for baseline demographics and comorbidities.','A total of 333 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria: 148 (44.44%) white/Caucasian, 123 (36.94%) black/African American, 54 (16.22%) Hispanic/Latinx, and 8 (2.40%) Asian. African American patients were sent to immediate care and rehabilitation significantly less often than Caucasian patients (RR 0.17 [95% CI 0.04-0.71]). There were no significant differences in mortality, length of stay, rates of surgical intervention, or total hospital charges among any of the racial groups.','The authors' findings suggest that racial disparities in inpatient cranial trauma care and outcomes may not be as prevalent as previously thought. In fact, the disparities seen were only in disposition. More research is needed to further elucidate and address disparities within this population, particularly those that may exist prior to, and after, hospitalization."
"Adult cancer disparities have been documented for decades and continue to persist despite clinical advancements in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. Pediatric cancer survival has improved significantly in the United States for the past 5 decades to over 80%; however, disparate outcomes among children and adolescents with cancer still affect many populations in the United States and globally, including racial and ethnic minorities, populations with low socioeconomic status, and residents of underserved areas. To achieve equitable outcomes for all children and adolescents with cancer, it is imperative that concerted multilevel approaches be carried out to understand and address health disparities and to ensure access to high-quality cancer care. Addressing social determinants of health, such as removing barriers to health care access and ensuring access to social supports, can reduce pediatric cancer disparities. Nevertheless, public health policy, health system interventions, and innovative delivery of evidence-based services are critically needed. Partnerships among patients, caregivers, and health care providers, and among health care, academic, and governmental institutions, have a pivotal role in reducing cancer disparities and improving outcomes in the 21st century."
"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Other than skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Lower uptake of mammography screening is associated with higher rates of late-stage breast cancers. This study aims to show geographic patterns in the United States, where rates of late-stage breast cancer are high and persistent over time, and examines factors associated with these patterns. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We examined all primary breast cancers diagnosed among all counties in 43 U.S. states with available data. We used spatial cluster analysis to identify hot spots (<i>i.e.,</i> spatial clusters with above average late-stage diagnosis rates among counties). Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were compared between persistent hot spots and those counties that were never hot spots. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Of the 2,599 counties examined in 43 states, 219 were identified as persistent hot spots. Counties with persistent hot spots (compared with counties that were never hot spots) were located in more deprived areas with worse housing characteristics, lower socioeconomic status, lower levels of health insurance, worse access to mammography, more isolated American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, or Hispanic neighborhoods, and larger income disparity. In addition, persistent hot spots were significantly more likely to be observed among poor, rural, African American, or Hispanic communities, but not among poor, rural, White communities. This analysis includes a broader range of socioeconomic conditions than those included in previous literature. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> We found geographic disparities in late-stage breast cancer diagnosis rates, with some communities experiencing persistent disparities over time. Our findings can guide public health efforts aimed at reducing disparities in stage of diagnosis for breast cancer."
"Quantify how observable characteristics contribute to influenza vaccination disparities among White, Black, and Hispanic nursing home (NH) residents.','Retrospective cohort.','Short- and long-stay U.S. NH residents aged ≥65 years.','We linked Minimum Data Set (MDS) and Medicare data to LTCFocUS and other facility data. We included residents with 6-month continuous enrollment in Medicare and an MDS assessment between October 1, 2013, and March 31, 2014. Residents were classified as short-stay (<100 days in NH) or long-stay (≥100 days in NH). We fit multivariable logistic regression models to assess the relationships between 27 resident and NH-level characteristics and receipt of influenza vaccination. Using nonlinear Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we decomposed the disparity in influenza vaccination between White versus Black and White versus Hispanic NH residents. Analyses were repeated separately for short- and long-stay residents.','Our study included 630,373 short-stay and 1,029,593 long-stay residents. Proportions vaccinated against influenza included 67.2% of White, 55.1% of Black, and 54.5% of Hispanic individuals among short-stay residents and 84.2%, 76.7%, and 80.8%, respectively among long-stay residents. Across 4 comparisons, the crude disparity in influenza vaccination ranged from 3.4 to 12.7 percentage points. By equalizing 27 prespecified characteristics, these disparities could be reduced 37.7% to 59.2%. Living in a predominantly White facility and proxies for NH quality were important contributors across all analyses. Characteristics unmeasured in our data (eg, NH staff attitudes and beliefs) may have also contributed significantly to the disparity.','The racial/ethnic disparity in influenza vaccination was most dramatic among short-stay residents. Intervening on factors associated with NH quality would likely reduce these disparities; however, future qualitative research is essential to explore potential contributors that were unmeasured in our data and to understand the degree to which these factors contribute to the overall disparity in influenza vaccination."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in breast cancer outcomes may be related to quality of care and reflected in emergency department (ED) visits following primary treatment. We examined racial/ethnic variation in ED visits following breast cancer surgery.','Using linked data from the California Cancer Registry and California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, we identified 151,229 women diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer between 2005 and 2013 who received surgical treatment. Differences in odds of having at least one breast cancer-related ED visit within 90 days post-surgery were estimated with logistic regression controlling for clinical and sociodemographic variables. Secondary analyses examined health care-related moderators of disparities.','Hispanics and non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks had an increased likelihood of having an ED visit within 90 days of surgery compared to NH Whites [OR = 1.11 (1.04-1.18), p = 0.0016; OR = 1.38 (1.27-1.50), p < 0.0001, respectively]; the likelihood was reduced in Asian/Pacific Islanders [aOR = 0.77 (0.71-0.84), p < 0.0001]. Medicaid and Medicare (vs. commercial insurance) increased the likelihood of ED visit for NH Whites, and to a lesser degree for Hispanics and NH Blacks (p < 0.0001 for interaction). Receipt of surgery at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center or at a for-profit (vs. non-profit) hospital was associated with reduced likelihood of ED visits for all groups.','Racial/ethnic disparities in ED visits following breast cancer surgery persist after controlling for clinical and sociodemographic variables. Improving quality of care following breast cancer surgery could improve outcomes for all groups."
"Despite well-established substance use disparities between sexual and gender minority adolescents and their heterosexual, cisgender peers, there remain questions about whether there are developmental differences in the onset and progression of these disparities across adolescence. These perspectives are critical for prevention efforts. We therefore estimate age-based patterns of five substance use behaviors across groups of adolescents defined by sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).','Data are from the 2013-2015 cycles of the California Healthy Kids Survey (N = 634,454). Substance use was assessed with past 30-day e-cigarette use, combustible cigarette use, alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and marijuana use. Two- and three-way interactions were used to assess differences in age-specific prevalence rates of each substance by (1) sex and sexual identity; and (2) gender identity.','Across all substances, SOGI differences in past 30-day use were present by age 12 years. Most disparities persisted to age 18 years and older. SOGI disparities in combustible and e-cigarette use were wider in late adolescence. Analyses by sexual identity show that sexual minority girls reported the highest rates of substance use across age, followed by sexual minority boys.','SOGI differences in substance use emerged in early adolescence and appeared to persist and accelerate by late adolescence. Sexual minority girls had the highest rates of substance use across all ages. The findings underscore the urgent need for screening and prevention strategies to reduce substance use for sexual and gender minority youth."
"Maternal morbidity and mortality (MMM) is a significant problem in the USA, with about 700 maternal deaths every year and an estimated 50,000 ""near misses."" Disparities in MMM by race are marked; black women are disproportionately affected. We use Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory to examine the root causes of racial disparities in MMM at the individual (microsystem), interpersonal (mesosystem), community (exosystem), and societal (macrosystem) levels of influence. This review discusses the interaction of these levels of influence on racial disparities related to MMM-covering preconception health, access to prenatal care, implicit bias among health care providers and its possible influence on obstetric care, ""maternity care deserts,"" and the need for quality improvement among black-serving hospitals. Relevant policies-parental leave, Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, and Medicaid expansion-are considered. We also apply the ecological systems theory to identify interventions that would most likely reduce disparities in MMM by race, such as revising the educational curricula of health care professionals, enhancing utilization of alternate prenatal care providers, and reforming Medicaid policies."
"Pressure ulcers increase the risk of costly hospitalization and mortality of nursing home residents, so timely healing is important. Disparities in healthcare have been identified in the nursing home population but little is known about disparities in the healing of pressure ulcers.','To assess racial and ethnic disparities in the healing of pressure ulcers present at nursing home admission. Multi-levels predictors, at the individual resident, nursing home, and community/Census tract level, were examined in three large data sets.','Minimum Data Set records of older individuals admitted to one of 439 nursing homes of a national, for-profit chain over three years with a stages 2-4 pressure ulcer (n=10,861) were searched to the 90-day assessment for the first record showing pressure ulcer healing. Predictors of pressure ulcer healing were analyzed for White admissions first using logistic regression. The Peters-Belson method was used to assess racial or ethnic disparities among minority group admissions.','A significantly smaller proportion of Black nursing home admissions had their pressure ulcer heal than expected had they been part of the White group. There were no disparities in pressure ulcer healing disadvantaging other minority groups. Significant predictors of a nonhealing of pressure ulcer were greater deficits in activities of daily living and pressure ulcer severity.','Reducing disparities in pressure ulcer healing is needed for Blacks admitted to nursing homes. Knowledge of disparities in pressure ulcer healing can direct interventions aiming to achieve equity in healthcare for a growing number of minority nursing home admissions."
"Rural-urban health disparities are still poorly understood, due to a considerable gap in knowledge, while a looming heart disease and stroke epidemic in China has caused global concern. This report attempts to fill in the knowledge gaps to examine if rural-urban disparities in heart disease and stroke mortality have widened, which population cohorts have experienced the greatest mortality growth and disparities, and if rurality still matters in China. Age-specific data from 2002 to 2016 published in the China Health Yearbooks were analyzed with the Joinpoint Regression Program. The results reveal that China faces a fast growing cardiovascular disease epidemic with widening rural-urban disparities. Rural death rates have grown higher than urban rates along with fast rising rural mortality, and the fastest increasing rates are found among rural men in younger age groups. These findings inspire further research into the causes of the disparities."
"Racial disparities in breastmilk provision and neonatal morbidities of extreme prematurity have been documented in previous studies but are not as well-documented in Asian and Pacific Islander (API) infants. The objectives of this study were to evaluate a predominantly API neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) population for racial disparities in (1) the receipt of breastmilk within 24 h of admission and at discharge and (2) neonatal morbidities among infants ≤ 28 weeks gestational age.','A retrospective chart review of 2528 infants from 2018 to 2020 born at the largest level 3 NICU in Honolulu, Hawai'i, was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed on NICU outcomes to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI).','Native Hawaiian (NH) (aOR 0.73 [0.54, 0.98]), Pacific Islander (PI) (aOR 0.57 [0.41, 0.79]), and Filipino infants (aOR 0.66 [0.49, 0.89]) were less likely to receive breastmilk at discharge compared to Asian infants. PI infants were also more likely to experience necrotizing enterocolitis (aOR 7.89 [1.07, 58.10]) and intraventricular hemorrhage (aOR 3.86 [1.15, 13.02]) compared to Asian infants.','In a predominantly API population, disparities in breastmilk receipt and neonatal morbidities exist among NH, PI, and Filipino infants in the NICU. Our findings call for better understanding of the underlying inequities to guide directed efforts, including standardization of care through staff trainings on implicit biases and trauma-informed care, as well as provision of culturally sensitive education and lactation support for these patients."
"Breast cancer is the most commonly experienced cancer among women. Its high rates of incidence and survival mean that a number of women will live it for periods of their lifetimes. Group differences in breast cancer incidence and mortality occur by race and ethnicity. For example, while white women are slightly more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, Black women are 40% more likely to die from the disease. In this article, rather than focusing the discussion on individual-level factors like health behaviors that have the potential to blame Black women and those living in poverty for their conditions, we view breast cancer disparities through the lens of Critical Race Theory, taking a historical perspective. This allows us to delve beyond individual risk factors to explore social determinants of breast cancer disparities at the population level, paying special attention to the myriad ways in which social factors, notably views of race and discriminatory public policies, over time have contributed to the disproportionate breast cancer mortality experienced by Black women. We suggest ways of addressing breast cancer disparities, including methods of training healthcare professionals and public policy directions, that include rather than marginalize Black and lower socioeconomic status women."
"Black adults in the United States have shorter sleep durations and poorer sleep efficiency relative to White adults, yet reasons for these disparities are not well explicated. The objective of this study was to examine neighborhood safety in childhood as a mediator of subsequent racial disparities in sleep.','Data were from Black and White young adults attending a large, predominantly White university in the Southeastern United States (N = 263; 52% Black, 53% female; Mean age = 19.21 years, SD = 1.01). Sleep parameters were assessed from eight nights of wrist actigraphy (time in bed, sleep duration, and efficiency) and an established self-report measure of daytime sleepiness. Residential histories from birth through age 18 were documented, and retrospective self-reports of neighborhood safety in childhood were assessed.','Black participants had less time in bed (p < 0.001), shorter sleep duration (p < 0.001), poorer sleep efficiency (p < 0.001), and more daytime sleepiness (p = 0.009) than White participants. Neighborhood safety mediated race differences in time in bed (p = 0.028), sleep duration (p = 0.033), and daytime sleepiness (p = 0.048), but not sleep efficiency. Findings were substantively unchanged after adjustment for family socioeconomic status, BMI, and substance use.','Findings support the hypothesis that neighborhood safety in childhood may partially account for race differences in subsequent sleep duration and daytime sleepiness. Addressing racial inequities in childhood neighborhood safety may be an important step toward reducing racial disparities in sleep health."
"Racial disparities persist in adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight (LBW), and infant mortality across the U.S. Although pervasive, these disparities are not universal. Some communities have experienced significant improvements in black (or African American) birth outcomes, both in absolute rates and in rate ratios relative to whites. This study assessed county-level progress on trends in black and white LBW rates as an indicator of progress toward more equal birth outcomes for black infants. County-level LBW data were obtained from the 2003 to 2013 U.S. Natality files. Black LBW rates, black-white rate ratios and percent differences over time were calculated. Trend lines were first assessed for significant differences in slope (i.e., converging, diverging, or parallel trend lines). For counties with parallel trend lines, intercepts were tested for statistically significant differences (sustained equality vs. persistent disparities). To assess progress, black LBW rates were compared to white LBW rates, and the trend lines were tested for significant decline. Each county's progress toward black-white equality was ultimately categorized into five possible trend patterns (n = 408): (1) converging LBW rates with reductions in the black LBW rate (decreasing disparities, n = 4, 1%); (2) converging LBW rates due to worsening white LBW rates (n = 5, 1%); (3) diverging LBW rates (increasing disparities, n = 9, 2%); (4) parallel LBW rates (persistent disparities, n = 373, 91%); and (5) overlapping trend lines (sustained equality, n = 18, 4%). Only four counties demonstrated improvement toward equality with decreasing black LBW rates. There is significant county-level variation in progress toward racial equality in adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight. Still, some communities are demonstrating that more equitable outcomes are possible. Further research is needed in these positive exemplar communities to identify what works in accelerating progress toward more equal birth outcomes."
"Appalachia-a region that stretches from Mississippi to New York-has historically been recognized as a socially and economically disadvantaged part of the United States, and growing evidence suggests that health disparities between it and the rest of the country are widening. We compared infant mortality and life expectancy disparities in Appalachia to those outside the region during the period 1990-2013. We found that infant mortality disparities widened for both whites and blacks, with infant mortality 16 percent higher in Appalachia in 2009-13, and the region's deficit in life expectancy increased from 0.6 years in 1990-92 to 2.4 years in 2009-13. The association between area poverty and life expectancy was stronger in Appalachia than in the rest of the United States. We found wide health disparities, including a thirteen-year gap in life expectancy among black men in high-poverty areas of Appalachia, compared to white women in low-poverty areas elsewhere. Higher mortality in Appalachia from cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, nephritis or kidney diseases, suicide, unintentional injuries, and drug overdose contributed to lower life expectancy in the region, compared to the rest of the country. Widening health disparities were also due to slower mortality improvements in Appalachia."
"Pervasive disparities in T2DM among minority adults are well-documented, and scholars have recently focused on the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in disparities. Yet, no research has summarized what is known about racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM. This review summarizes the current literature on racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM, discusses SDOH that are common among youth with T2DM, and introduces a conceptual model on the possible role of SDOH in youth-onset T2DM disparities.','Minority youth have disparities in the onset of T2DM, quality of life, and family burden. Low family income and parental education and high youth stress are common negative SDOH among families of youth with T2DM. No studies have examined the role of SDOH in racial/ethnic disparities in youth-onset T2DM. Future research should examine whether SDOH contribute to disparities in T2DM prevalence and psychosocial outcomes among minority youth."
"The goal of this analysis is to assess the effectiveness of a summer program designed to introduce high school students of color to health disparities research. A total of 73 students (69.9% Black, 68.5% female and 80.6% either junior/senior) participated in the 4-week Health Disparities Summer Internship Program (HDSIP) during the years 2012-2015. Students attended lectures covering topics such as health disparities, community-based participatory research (CBPR), immigrant health, and policy and advocacy. While working with community-based organizations, students gained hands-on experience related to issues discussed in class. Students completed research projects and provided suggestions for health policy change. Pre/post surveys were completed to evaluate the program. After participating in the HDSIP, students demonstrated heightened awareness of the social determinants of health, especially in regards to racial discrimination (p = .023); borderline statistically significant increases were shown for income (p = .082), community safety (p = .058), and healthcare access (p = .076). Most students (82.1%) planned to advocate for changes in their community; an increase from the initial 65.2% (p = .052). About nine out of ten students (89.6%) reported being satisfied with the summer program; the majority reported improvement in analytical skills, CBPR methods, and oral/communication skills. Increasing diversity in the health workforce has widely been proposed as a means of addressing health disparities. Introducing minority students to health professions can serve as a catalyst for lasting changes in health outcomes. The HDSIP has increased students' awareness of social determinants of health and has fostered their interest in improving the health of minority populations."
"To assess county-level socioeconomic disparities in medical service usage for infections among Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes (MBWDs) who had fee-for-service health insurance claims during 2012.','We used Medicare claims data to calculate percentage of MBWDs with infections.','Medicare beneficiaries.','We estimated the percentage of MBWDs who used medical services for each of 3 groups of infections by sex and quintiles of the prevalence of social factors in the person's county of residence: anatomic site-specific infections; pathogen-specific infections; and HHST infections (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis).','Using quintiles of county-specific socioeconomic determinants, we calculated absolute and relative disparities in each group of infections for male and female MBWDs. We also used regression-based summary measures to estimate the overall average absolute and relative disparities for each infection group.','Of the 4.5 million male MBWDs, 15.8%, 25.3%, and 2.7% had 1 or more site-specific, pathogen-specific, and HHST infections, respectively. Results were similar for females (n = 5.2 million). The percentage of MBWDs with 1 or more infections in each group increased as social disadvantage in the MBWDs' county of residence increased. Absolute and relative county-level socioeconomic disparities in receipt of medical services for 1 or more infections (site- or pathogen-specific) were 12.9 or less percentage points and 65.5% or less, respectively. For HHST infections, percentage of MBWDs having 1 or more HHST infections for persons residing in the highest quintile (Q5) was 3- to 4-fold higher (P < .001) than persons residing in the lowest quintile (Q1).','Infection burden among MBWDs is generally associated with county-level contextual socioeconomic disadvantage, and the extent of health disparities varies by infection category, socioeconomic factor, and quintiles of socioeconomic disadvantage. The findings imply ongoing need for efforts to identify effective interventions for reducing county-level social disparities in infections among patients with diabetes."
"In the United States, about half of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) receive treatment within 60 minutes of hospital arrival. We aimed to determine the proportion of patients receiving tPA within 60 minutes (door-to-needle time [DTNT] ≤60) and 45 minutes (DTNT ≤45) of hospital arrival by race/ethnicity and sex and to identify temporal trends in DTNT ≤60 and DTNT ≤45.','Among 65 654 acute ischemic stroke admissions in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-funded FL-PR CReSD study (Florida-Puerto Rico Collaboration to Reduce Stroke Disparities) from 2010 to 2015, we included 6181 intravenous tPA-treated cases (9.4%). Generalized estimating equations were used to determine predictors of DTNT ≤60 and DTNT ≤45.','DTNT ≤60 was achieved in 42% and DTNT ≤45 in 18% of cases. After adjustment, women less likely received DTNT ≤60 (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.92) and DTNT ≤45 (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.93). Compared with Whites, Blacks less likely had DTNT ≤45 during off hours (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.98). Achievement of DTNT ≤60 and DTNT ≤45 was highest in South Florida (50%, 23%) and lowest in West Central Florida (28%, 11%).','In the FL-PR CReSD, achievement of DTNT ≤60 and DTNT ≤45 remains low. Compared with Whites, Blacks less likely receive tPA treatment within 45 minutes during off hours.

Further research is needed to identify reasons for delayed thrombolytic treatment in women and Blacks and factors contributing to regional disparities in DTNT."
"Research documents substantial adolescent health disparities by sexual orientation, but studies are confined to a small number of countries-chiefly the USA. We provide first-time evidence of associations between sexual orientation and adolescent health/well-being in a new country-Australia. We also add to knowledge by examining health/well-being outcomes not previously analysed in national samples, considering adolescents reporting no sexual attractions, and rank-ordering sexual-orientation health disparities by magnitude.','Data from an Australian national probability sample of 14/15 years old (<i>Longitudinal Study of Australian Children</i>, n=3318) and regression models adjusted for confounding and for multiple comparisons were used to examine the associations between sexual attraction and 30 outcomes spanning multiple domains of health/well-being-including socio-emotional functioning, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, health-related behaviours, social support, self-harm, suicidality, victimisation, self-concept, school belonging and global health/well-being assessments.','Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning adolescents displayed significantly worse health/well-being than their heterosexual peers in all outcomes (p<0.05). The magnitude of the disparities ranged between 0.13 and 0.75 SD, and was largest in the domains of self-harm, suicidality, peer problems and emotional problems. There were fewer differences between the heterosexual and no-attraction groups. Worse outcomes were observed among both-sex-attracted adolescents compared with same-sex-attracted adolescents, and sexual-minority girls compared with sexual-minority boys.','Consistent with the minority stress model and recent international scholarship, sexual-minority status is an important risk factor for poor adolescent health/well-being across domains in Australia. Interventions aimed at addressing sexual-orientation health disparities within Australian adolescent populations are urgently required."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted minority communities, yet little data exists regarding whether disparities have improved at a health system level. This study examined whether sociodemographic disparities in hospitalization and clinical outcomes changed between two temporal waves of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.','This is a retrospective cohort study of primary care patients at Mass General Brigham (a large northeastern health system serving 1.27 million primary care patients) hospitalized in-system with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2021, categorized into two 6-month ""wave"" periods. We used chi-square tests to compare demographics between waves, and regression analysis to characterize the association of race/ethnicity and language with in-hospital severe outcomes (death, hospice discharge, intensive unit care need).','Hispanic/Latino, Black, and non-English-speaking patients constituted 30.3%, 12.5%, and 29.7% of COVID-19 admissions in wave 1 (N = 5844) and 22.2%, 9.0%, and 22.7% in wave 2 (N = 4007), compared to 2019 general admission proportions of 8.8%, 6.3%, and 7.7%, respectively. Admissions from highly socially vulnerable census tracts decreased between waves. Non-English speakers had significantly higher odds of severe illness during wave 1 (OR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.66) compared to English speakers; this association was non-significant during wave 2 (OR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.36).','Comparing two COVID-19 temporal waves, significant sociodemographic disparities in COVID-19 admissions improved between waves but continued to persist over a year, demonstrating the need for ongoing interventions to truly close equity gaps. Non-English-speaking language status independently predicted worse hospitalization outcomes in wave 1, underscoring the importance of targeted and effective in-hospital supports for non-English speakers."
"Research on health disparities in thoracic surgery is based on large population-based studies, which is associated with certain biases. Several methodological challenges are associated with these biases and warrant review and attention. The lack of standardized definitions in health disparities research requires clarification for study design strategy. Further inconsistencies remain when considering data sources and collection methods. These inconsistencies pose challenges for accurate and standardized downstream data analysis and interpretation. These sources of bias should be considered when establishing the infrastructure of health disparities research in thoracic surgery, which is in its infancy and requires further development."
"The objective is to apply the Institute of Medicine definition of healthcare disparities in order to compare (1) racial/ethnic disparities in general medical care use among older adults with and without comorbid mental health need and (2) racial/ethnic disparities in general medical care use within the group with comorbid mental health need.','Data were obtained from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (years 2004-2012). The sample included 21,263 participants aged 65+ years (14,973 non-Latino Caucasians, 3530 African-Americans, and 2760 Latinos). Physical illness was determined by having one of the 11 priority chronic health illnesses. Comorbid mental health need was defined as having one of the chronic illnesses plus a Kessler-6 Scale >12, or two-item Patient Health Questionnaire >2. General medical care use refers to receipt of non-mental health specialty care. Two-part generalized linear models were used to estimate and compare general medical care use and expenditures among older adults with and without a comorbid mental health need.','Racial/ethnic disparities in general medical care expenditures were greater among those with comorbid mental health need compared with those without. Among those with comorbid mental health need, non-Latino Caucasians had significantly greater expenditures on prescription drug use than African-Americans and Latinos.','Expenditure disparities reflect differences in the amount of resources provided to African-Americans and Latinos compared with non-Latino Caucasians. This is not equivalent to disparities in quality of care. Interventions and policies are needed to ensure that racial/ethnic minority older adults receive equitable services that enable them to manage effectively their comorbid mental and physical health needs.

"Evidence of racial disparities in the receipt of postmastectomy breast reconstruction is well documented. The objective of this study was to describe trends in racial disparities overall and by reconstructive technique.','The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify women who underwent mastectomy and/or breast reconstruction from 2005 to 2014. Patient demographics were recorded, and cases were grouped by reconstructive status and technique. Trends were assessed with the Cochran-Armitage test and the index of disparity.','Over the study period, 92,960 postmastectomy patients were identified (77,049 white women, 10,396 black women, 4939 Asian women, and 576 Native American women), of whom 46,931 underwent reconstruction. Of these, 7692 women underwent autologous reconstructions (3913 free flaps and 3696 pedicled flaps). From 2005 to 2014, receipt of breast reconstruction by postmastectomy patients rose from 33.2% to 60.0%, receipt of autologous reconstruction by patients who underwent breast reconstruction fell from 30.4% to 15.9%, and receipt of free-flap reconstruction by patients who underwent autologous reconstruction rose from 15.0% to 70.8%. These trends were significant in all racial subgroups (P < .001), except for Native Americans (P = .269). The index of disparity decreased from 51.4% to 22.6% for overall receipt of breast reconstruction, decreased from 10.7% to 7.0% for tissue expander and implant-based reconstruction, increased from 18.0% to 27.3% for autologous reconstruction, and decreased from 66.7% to 4.3% for free-flap reconstruction.','The use of postmastectomy breast reconstruction is steadily rising in the United States.

"Health equity for Indigenous peoples in the context of surgery has recently become topical amongst surgeons in Australasia. Health inequities are amongst the most consistent and compelling disparities between Māori and New Zealand Europeans (NZE) in New Zealand (NZ). We aimed to investigate where ethnic disparities in surgical care may occur and highlight some of the potential contributing factors, over all surgical specialties, between Māori and NZE adults in NZ.','A systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A series of electronic searches were performed in Medline, Embase, PubMed and CINAHL.','Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies employed a range of indicators for surgical care including receipt of surgery following diagnosis, delays to treatment and post-operative morbidity and mortality. Disparities in the receipt of surgical treatment for several cancers were observed for Māori and remained after adjustment for socioeconomic variables and extent of disease. Māori were more likely to experience delays in treatment and referral to other medical specialties involved in their care.','Despite the significant variation in the types of diseases, procedures and indicators of surgical care of the included studies, consistent findings are that disparities in different aspects of surgical care exist between Māori and NZE in NZ. This review highlights the need to better quantify the important issue of health equity for Māori in surgery given the lack of studies over the majority of surgical specialties."

These indicators were summed in a cumulative disadvantage index (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or 6).','Self-reported current, former (ever smoked ≥100 cigarettes, had since quit, and not currently smoking), and never (<100 cigarettes) smoking.','Among 278 048 respondents (mean [SD] age, 51.9 [16.8] years; 55.7% female) with data on smoking history (99.5% of the sample), the mean current smoking prevalence across 2008 to 2017 compared with populations without disadvantages was successively higher among populations with 1 disadvantage (21.4% vs 13.8%; current vs never smoking adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.34; 95% CI, 2.27-2.43), 2 disadvantages (26.6% vs 13.8%; OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 3.39-3.72), 3 disadvantages (35.1% vs 13.8%; OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 5.05-5.66), 4 disadvantages (45.7% vs 13.8%; OR, 8.59; 95% CI, 7.91-9.34), or 5 or 6 disadvantages (58.2% vs 13.8%; OR, 14.70; 95% CI, 12.30-17.50). In current vs former and former vs never smoking status contrasts, ORs were lower but also showed successively greater associations with increasing cumulative disadvantage. Current (vs never) smoking odds significantly declined each year among populations with 0 (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.96), 1 (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.97), or 2 (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99) disadvantages but did not change across 2008 to 2017 among those with 3 or more disadvantages.','Results of this study demonstrate that US disparities in smoking prevalence from 2008 to 2017 were successively larger with each additional disadvantage faced, were expressed in higher smoking initiation odds and lower smoking cessation odds, and widened over time."
"ASCO strives, through research, education, and promotion of the highest quality of patient care, to create a world where cancer is prevented and every survivor is healthy. In this pursuit, cancer health equity remains the guiding institutional principle that applies to all its activities across the cancer care continuum. In 2009, ASCO committed to addressing differences in cancer outcomes in its original policy statement on cancer disparities. Over the past decade, despite novel diagnostics and therapeutics, together with changes in the cancer care delivery system such as passage of the Affordable Care Act, cancer disparities persist. Our understanding of the populations experiencing disparate outcomes has likewise expanded to include the intersections of race/ethnicity, geography, sexual orientation and gender identity, sociodemographic factors, and others. This updated statement is intended to guide ASCO's future activities and strategies to achieve its mission of conquering cancer for all populations. ASCO acknowledges that much work remains to be done, by all cancer stakeholders at the systems level, to overcome historical momentum and existing social structures responsible for disparate cancer outcomes. This updated statement affirms ASCO's commitment to moving beyond descriptions of differences in cancer outcomes toward achievement of cancer health equity, with a focus on improving equitable access to care, improving clinical research, addressing structural barriers, and increasing awareness that results in measurable and timely action toward achieving cancer health equity for all."
"Background Less than 40% of acute stroke patients have computed tomography (CT) imaging performed within 25 minutes of hospital arrival. We aimed to examine the race-ethnic and sex differences in door-to-CT (DTCT) ≤25 minutes in the FSR (Florida Stroke Registry). Methods and Results Data were collected from 2010 to 2018 for 63 265 patients with acute ischemic stroke from the FSR and secondary analysis was performed on 15 877 patients with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator-treated ischemic stroke. Generalized estimating equation models were used to determine predictors of DTCT ≤25. DTCT ≤25 was achieved in 56% of cases of suspected acute stroke, improving from 36% in 2010 to 72% in 2018. Women (odds ratio [OR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93) and Black (OR, 0.88; CI, 0.84-0.94) patients who had strokes were less likely, and Hispanic patients more likely (OR, 1.07; CI, 1.01-1.14), to achieve DTCT ≤25. In a secondary analysis among intravenous tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients, 81% of patients achieved DTCT ≤25. In this subgroup, women were less likely to receive DTCT ≤25 (0.85, 0.77-0.94) whereas no significant differences were observed by race or ethnicity. Conclusions In the FSR, there was considerable improvement in acute stroke care metric DTCT ≤25 in 2018 in comparison to 2010. However, sex and race-ethnic disparities persist and require further efforts to improve performance and reduce these disparities."
"Race predicts overall mortality (OM) of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) in the United States (US). We assessed whether racial disparities affect cancer-specific mortality (CSM) using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.','Adults with LSCC from 2004 to 2015 were selected. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing-risks regression analysis adjusted for clinicodemographic factors defined hazard ratios (aHR).','We identified 14,506 patients. The median age was 63 years. Most were male (11,725, 80.8%) and white (11,653, 80.3%), followed by Black (2294, 15.8%). Most had early-stage disease (7544, 52.0%) and received radiotherapy only (4107, 28.3%), followed by chemoradiation (3748, 25.8%). With median follow-up of 60 months, overall 3- and 5-year OM were 34.0% and 43.2%; CSM were 16.0% and 18.9%, respectively. Black patients had higher OM than white patients on univariable (HR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.26-1.44, P < .001) and multivariable (aHR 1.10, 95% CI, 1.02-1.18, P = .011) analyses. Black patients had higher CSM on univariable analysis (HR 1.22, 95% CI, 1.09-1.35, P < .001) but not on multivariable CSM analysis (aHR 1.01, 95% CI, 0.90-1.13, P = .864). On multivariable analysis, year of diagnosis, age, disease site, stage, treatment, nodal metastasis, marital status, education, and geography significantly predicted CSM.','On multivariable analyses controlling for sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics, Black and white patients differed in OM but not in CSM. However, Black patients presented with greater proportions of higher stage cancers and sociodemographic factors such as income and marital status that were associated with worse outcomes. Efforts to target sociodemographic disparities may contribute to the mitigation of racial disparities in LSCC.','4 Laryngoscope, 131:E1147-E1155, 2021."
"This study examined the receipt of therapies for cancer, hypertension, and diabetes in association with age and racial disparities in mortality among women with breast cancer.','This study identified 92,829 women diagnosed with breast cancer at age ≥ 65 years in 2007-2015 with follow-up to 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database.','There were substantial age and racial disparities in the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, which was higher in women ≥ 75 (86.3% and 32.0%) than younger women 65-74 (72.8% and 29.3%), and the highest in Black women (91.1% and 49.1%), followed by Asian women (80.2% and 40.5%), and White women (77.6 and 27.8%). Black women were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy (odds ratio: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.64-0.75), radiation therapy (0.87, 0.83-0.92), and hormone therapy (0.80, 0.76-0.85), but significantly more likely to receive antihypertensive (1.26, 1.19-1.33) and antidiabetic (1.19, 1.10-1.28) drugs than White women, after adjusting for sociodemographic and tumor factors. As compared to White women, Black women had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (1.46, 1.41-1.52), but it became insignificant after adjusting for treatment factors (1.01, 0.97-1.06), whereas the adjusted risk of breast cancer-specific mortality remained significantly higher (1.08, 1.01-1.15) in Black women; Asian and other ethnic women had a significantly lower risk of all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality.','There were substantial age and racial disparities in the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes and in the receipt of medications. Black women did not have a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality but had a significantly higher risk of breast cancer-specific mortality as compared to White women."
"Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat anxiety and panic disorders. White patients are more likely to receive a benzodiazepine prescription than non-White patients in different medical settings. Racial-ethnic disparities have also been found in prescription of opioids from the emergency room. It is not known whether racial disparities in benzodiazepine prescriptions exist at the emergency department level. This study aims to analyze the relationship between benzodiazepine prescriptions for anxiety in an emergency department setting.','Data for this cross-sectional study was obtained from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) Years 2009-2018. Patients ≥ 18 years of age presenting to the emergency department with anxiety were identified. Adjusted survey logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the patient characteristics and receipt of benzodiazepines.','This study analyzed 1,174,556,119 emergency department (ED) visits out of which 2.8% had a diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Prevalence of anxiety was higher in the following groups: females, younger age range (18-34 years old), and non-Hispanic (NH) White. Rates of benzodiazepine prescription for patients with anxiety were higher for NH-White and Hispanic patients at 29% and 28% respectively than for NH-Black and NH-Other (24% and 21% respectively). Compared to NH-White patients, NH-Black patients were 36% less likely to be prescribed a benzodiazepine (prevalence ratio (PR) = 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.76) and Hispanic patients were 19% less likely to be prescribed a benzodiazepine (PR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.68-0.96). Age, sex, or type of insurance did not show a statistically significant influence in the prescription of benzodiazepines.','These findings reveal that NH-Black and Hispanic patients with anxiety are significantly less likely to be prescribed benzodiazepines than their NH-White counterparts in the ED. Further studies are needed to determine the root causes of these health disparities and strategies to combat them."
"No research exists on how body mass index (BMI) changes with age over the full life span and social disparities therein. This study aims to fill the gap using an innovative life-course research design and analytic methods to model BMI trajectories from early adolescence to old age across 20th-century birth cohorts and test sociodemographic variation in such trajectories. We conducted the pooled integrative data analysis (IDA) to combine data from four national population-based NIH longitudinal cohort studies that collectively cover multiple stages of the life course (Add Health, MIDUS, ACL, and HRS) and estimate mixed-effects models of age trajectories of BMI for men and women. We examined associations of BMI trajectories with birth cohort, race/ethnicity, parental education, and adult educational attainment. We found higher mean levels of and larger increases in BMI with age across more recent birth cohorts as compared with earlier-born cohorts. Black and Hispanic excesses in BMI compared with Whites were present early in life and persisted at all ages, and, in the case of Black-White disparities, were of larger magnitude for more recent cohorts. Higher parental and adulthood educational attainment were associated with lower levels of BMI at all ages. Women with college-educated parents also experienced less cohort increase in mean BMI. Both race and education disparities in BMI trajectories were larger for women compared with men."
"Background Stroke remains one of the leading causes of disability and death in the United States. We characterized 10-year nationwide trends in use of comfort care interventions (CCIs) among patients with ischemic stroke, particularly pertaining to acute thrombolytic therapy with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator and endovascular thrombectomy, and describe in-hospital outcomes and costs. Methods and Results We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample from 2006 to 2015 and identified adult patients with ischemic stroke with or without thrombolytic therapy and CCIs using validated <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> (<i>ICD-9</i><i>)</i> codes. We report adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI of CCI usage across five 2-year periods. Of 4 249 201 ischemic stroke encounters, 3.8% had CCI use. CCI use increased over time (adjusted OR, 4.80; 95% CI, 4.15-5.55) regardless of acute treatment type. Advanced age, female sex, White race, non-Medicare insurance, higher income, disease severity, comorbidity burden, and discharge from non-northeastern teaching hospitals were independently associated with receiving CCIs. In the fully adjusted model, thrombolytic therapy and endovascular thrombectomy, respectively, conferred a 6% and 10% greater likelihood of receiving CCIs. Among CCI users, there was a significant decline in in-hospital mortality compared with all other dispositions over time (adjusted OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.38-0.56). Despite longer length of stay, CCI hospitalizations incurred 16% lower adjusted costs. Conclusions CCI use among patients with ischemic stroke has increased regardless of acute treatment type. Nonetheless, considerable disparities persist. Closing the disparities gap and optimizing access, outcomes, and costs for CCIs among patients with stroke are important avenues for further research."
"In the fall 2010, East Carolina University's Department of Public Health in the Brody School of Medicine introduced a new graduate certificate online program to its curriculum-the Ethnic and Rural Health Disparities (ERHD) program. By the spring 2014, the Ethnic and Rural Health Disparities (ERHD) program graduated 20 public health professionals with expertise in ethnic and rural health disparities. In order to examine its effectiveness, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative study of our graduates. The major objectives of our ERHD alumni study were: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of the ERHD program, and (2) to assess new strategies for improving our ERHD program. Quantitative and qualitative results from our small sample of alumni indicate that the ERHD program is fulfilling its objectives. The ERHD program has developed a new online strategy in teaching racial and ethnic health and health disparities for public health professionals who are ready to not only address health disparities in a different approach but also ready to develop new culturally competent public health programs for increasing diverse racial, ethnic, and rural populations in the U.S.A."
"To quantify disparities in accessibility and availability of pediatric primary care by modeling interventions across multiple states that compare publicly insured versus privately insured children, and urban versus rural communities.','Secondary data sources include 2013 National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, 2009 MAX Medicaid claims, 2012 American Community Survey.','The study models accessibility and availability of care for all children in seven states.','Optimization modeling with access constraints is used to estimate access.

Mississippi has the lowest availability for both populations. Overall, the disparities in availability for pediatric primary care are not as significant as in accessibility. Both rural and urban communities are in need of improvement in accessibility to primary care for publicly insured children, although at varying levels across states.','Disparities in availability are not as significant as disparities in accessibility. Opportunities to improve access to pediatric primary care vary by state.

"This special issue seeks to characterize the current state of the science regarding risk and protective factors influencing resilience and thriving in relation to substance use among ethnic minorities and other underserved populations. This epilogue examines the scope of work presented in this special issue, the added value of the research presented herein, and how it can inform future research directions. Health disparities research can be conducted using two key approaches: 1) documenting <i>between-group differences</i> comparing ethnic/racial minorities groups and majority populations; or, 2) documenting <i>within-group differences</i> in a single racial or ethnic group. While characterization of <i>between-group differences</i> is useful to identify existing health disparities, it is essential to understand within-group diversity to fully address these inequities. Studies in this special issue identifying between- group differences focus on resiliency characteristics that could be present across all racial and ethnic groups. The studies examining within-group differences included in this special issue examine novel factors that influence resilience of protective health behaviors. Overall, this special issue examines several potential protective factors in the context of health promoting behaviors related to substance use using a wide range of research methodologies. While it is not exhaustive in its representation of all underserved populations experiencing health disparities and treatment inequities, this special issue includes a broad array of populations from various racial, ethnic, and national groups. Although we have to adequately explore thriving, the current special issue establishes a firm foundation for research on resilience that may extend to thriving."
"Ethnic and racial minorities in many countries experience worse relative health outcomes and earlier mortality compared to national averages or outcomes of the majority population. Although socioeconomic status often contributes to a portion of ethno-racial health disparities, there are many unanswered questions about the relationship between socioeconomic status and ethno-racial health disparities across contexts. Recent scholarship in the USA has found support for a ""diminished returns"" effect in which the socioeconomic health gradient is systematically smaller for marginalized groups, yet it is unclear whether this pattern exists in other national contexts. This study tests the interaction between socioeconomic status and ethno-racial minority status in 30 countries across six waves of the European Social Survey. The results include evidence of the diminished returns pattern, particularly for populations with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Multilevel mixed-effects models find variation across countries in the interaction between socioeconomic status and ethno-racial minority status. The findings suggest racism and socioeconomic status interact to affect health and health disparities in multiple contexts and highlight the importance of cross-national comparison to further understand variation across countries."
"Reducing tobacco-related health disparities has been a public health priority for more than 2 decades, yet disparities in cigarette use have remained steady or worsened. Less is known about how disparities in other tobacco products have changed over time. Our study examined trends in cigarette and other tobacco product use in Minnesota with the goal of informing efforts aimed at reducing disparities.','We examined tobacco use disparities as a function of education, income, and race across the Minnesota Adult Tobacco Survey results in 2010 (N = 7,057), 2014 (N = 9,304), and 2018 (N = 6,055). Tobacco use was captured by assessing past 30-day use of 4 tobacco products: cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco, plus combustibles (ie, cigarettes and/or cigars) and any tobacco (ie, use of any of the 4 products).','At each wave, those with lower income and education reported greater use of cigarettes, combustibles, and any tobacco than those with higher income and education. Black respondents were more likely to report cigar and combustibles use than White respondents in 2018, whereas White respondents were more likely to report smokeless tobacco use in 2014. We saw no significant wave-by-demographic interactions, suggesting that the magnitude of the disparity remained unchanged over time for any tobacco product.','Substantial disparities in tobacco use remain across education, income, and race, even in a state such as Minnesota with a strong tobacco control program. Additional efforts are needed to close disparity gaps and reach endgame tobacco use targets for all subpopulations."
"Vaccines can prevent illness but are effective only if they reach a majority of the population at risk. Disparities based on many factors, such as race and ethnicity, economic status, and rural versus urban locations of residents, are ongoing issues in the United States. Reasons for disparities include cost, access, coverage, attitudes/beliefs, and systems issues. At the government level, programs like Vaccines for Children, Medicaid reform, Medicare, and state efforts funded in part by 317 grants have helped reduce but not eliminate disparities. At a practice level, vaccine disparities can be addressed by community outreach and systems to offer and deliver vaccines."
"<i>Objectives.</i> To examine rural-urban disparities in overall mortality and leading causes of death across Hispanic (any race) and non-Hispanic White, Black, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Asian/Pacific Islander populations.<i>Methods.</i> We performed a retrospective analysis of age-adjusted death rates for all-cause mortality and 5 leading causes of death (cardiovascular, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke) by rural versus urban county of residence in the United States and race/ethnicity for the period 2013 to 2017.<i>Results.</i> Rural populations, across all racial/ethnic groups, had higher all-cause mortality rates than did their urban counterparts. Comparisons within causes of death documented rural disparities for all conditions except cancer and stroke among Hispanic individuals; Hispanic rural residents had death rates similar to or lower than urban residents. Rural Black populations experienced the highest mortality for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and stroke. Unintentional injury and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality were highest in rural AI/AN and rural non-Hispanic White populations, respectively.<i>Conclusions.</i> Investigating rural-urban disparities without also considering race/ethnicity leaves minority health disparities unexamined and thus unaddressed. Further research is needed to clarify local factors associated with these disparities and to test appropriate interventions."
"A major goal of health disparities research is to identify and intervene upon modifiable risk factors that help explain the observed associations between social factors and adverse health outcomes. To this end, statistical methods incorporating mediation analysis have shown promise, as they quantify the contribution of an intermediate variable in an exposure-outcome association. A growing body of literature suggests that environmental chemicals can contribute to health disparities. However, evaluating environmental chemicals as an important component of health disparities introduces methodological complexities that may make standard mediation approaches inadequate. Specific to environmental health is the issue of evaluating both the source and biomarker of the environmental toxicant in order to calculate the proportion of the disparity that would remain had we intervened on the modifiable factors. Recent methodological developments on multiple mediators can improve efforts to integrate both source and biomarker of exposure into epidemiological studies of health disparities. We illustrate a conceptual framework and present how mediation techniques can be used to address environmental health disparities questions. With this, we provide a methodological tool that has the potential to advance this growing field, while simultaneously informing public health prevention and policy surrounding the impact of environmental factors on health disparities."
"As of 1 November 2020, there have been >230 000 deaths and 9 million confirmed and probable cases attributable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States. However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race/ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the US coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.','We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks.','In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than for Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 (age-standardized incidence, 1626/100 000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate, 244/100 000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% posterior credible interval [CrI], 5.4-5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI, 6.4-7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates.','This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community, and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates."
"Maternal morbidity and mortality, important indicators of healthcare quality both nationally and internationally, have gained increasing public attention in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. has the highest rate of maternal mortality among high-income countries; notably, this rate has more than doubled since 1990. Black women in the U.S. die at three to four times the rate of white women from pregnancy-related complications, one of the widest of all racial disparities in women's health. Medical complications, including cardiovascular disease and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, remain leading contributors to disparities in maternal outcomes including pregnancy-related deaths. However, an under-explored opportunity for improvement is the failure to transition from obstetrical to primary care, which limits optimizing postpartum health. Health system approaches, community-based interventions, and policy solutions that facilitate transitions of care may be critical to eliminating persistent disparities in maternal outcomes."
"Disparities in adult morbidity and mortality may be rooted in patterns of biological dysfunction in early life. We sought to examine the association between pathogen burden and a cumulative deficits index (CDI), conceptualized as a pre-clinical marker of an unhealthy biomarker profile, specifically focusing on patterns across levels of social disadvantage.','Using the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004 wave (aged 20-49 years), we examined the association of pathogen burden, composed of seven pathogens, with the CDI. The CDI comprised 28 biomarkers corresponding to available clinical laboratory measures. Models were stratified by race/ethnicity and education level.','The CDI ranged from 0.04 to 0.78. Nearly half of Blacks were classified in the high burden pathogen class compared with 8% of Whites. Among both Mexican Americans and other Hispanic groups, the largest proportion of individuals were classified in the common pathogens class. Among educational classes, 19% of those with less than a high school education were classified in the high burden class compared with 7% of those with at least a college education. Blacks in the high burden pathogen class had a CDI 0.05 greater than those in the low burden class (P < 0.05). Whites in the high burden class had a CDI only 0.03 greater than those in the low burden class (P < 0.01).','Our findings suggest there are significant social disparities in the distribution of pathogen burden across race/ethnic groups, and the effects of pathogen burden may be more significant for socially disadvantaged individuals."
"The theoretical landscape of health disparities research now emphasizes health inequities and the role that social determinants of health (SDOH) play in creating and perpetuating them. Whether National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding patterns reflect this theoretical shift is unknown.','The aim of this study was to examine the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) funding for research focused on health disparities, health inequities, and SDOH, relative to other key NIH institutes.','Data on 32,968 projects funded by NINR, the National Cancer Institute, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) during the years 2000 through 2016 were downloaded from NIH RePORTER; those with health disparities, health inequity, or SDOH terms used in the abstract were identified. Descriptive statistics and a general linear model approach were used to assess differences in cumulative project counts and funding proportions, and funding trends over time.','Overall, funding for health disparities projects was 14-19 times greater than for health inequity and SDOH projects and was more concentrated in centers and institutional training than in individual research projects. NINR's proportion of funding for disparities projects was consistently greater than that of the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, but not for inequities and SDOH projects. NIMHD's proportion of funding for disparities, and inequities and SDOH projects (combined) was 2-30 times greater than that of other institutes. Over the 16-year period, funding for disparities, inequity, and SDOH projects each increased (all ps < .05); however, growth in inequities and SDOH funding was not evident in more recent years.','Funding for projects focused on health equities and the SDOH lag behind theoretical shifts in the broader health disparities research arena. With the exception of NIMHD, there is a disconnect between funding for projects with a disparities orientation in institutional training and center projects relative to individual research projects. These trends have implications for nurse scientists seeking NIH funding to support health equity-oriented research."
"To characterize US mayors' and health commissioners' opinions about health disparities in their cities and identify factors associated with these opinions.','We conducted a multimodal survey of mayors and health commissioners in fall-winter 2016 (n = 535; response rate = 45.2%). We conducted bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression.','Forty-two percent of mayors and 61.1% of health commissioners strongly agreed that health disparities existed in their cities. Thirty percent of mayors and 8.0% of health commissioners believed that city policies could have little or no impact on disparities. Liberal respondents were more likely than were conservative respondents to strongly agree that disparities existed (mayors: odds ratio [OR] = 7.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.22, 16.84; health commissioners: OR = 5.09; 95% CI = 3.07, 8.46). In regression models, beliefs that disparities existed, were avoidable, and were unfair were independently associated with the belief that city policies could have a major impact on disparities.','Many mayors, and some health commissioners, are unaware of the potential of city policies to reduce health disparities. Ideology is strongly associated with opinions about disparities among these city policymakers. Public Health Implications: Information about health disparities, and policy strategies to reduce them, needs to be more effectively communicated to city policymakers."
"Although there is increasing awareness of disparities in COVID-19 infection risk among vulnerable communities, the effect of behavioral interventions at the scale of individual neighborhoods has not been fully studied. We develop a method to quantify neighborhood activity behaviors at high spatial and temporal resolutions and test whether, and to what extent, behavioral responses to social-distancing policies vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We define <i>exposure density</i> ([Formula: see text]) as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring in distinct land-use types. Using detailed neighborhood data for New York City, we quantify neighborhood exposure density using anonymized smartphone geolocation data over a 3-mo period covering more than 12 million unique devices and rasterize granular land-use information to contextualize observed activity. Next, we analyze disparities in community social distancing by estimating variations in neighborhood activity by land-use type before and after a mandated stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effects of localized demographic, socioeconomic, and built-environment density characteristics on infection rates and deaths in order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our findings demonstrate distinct behavioral patterns across neighborhoods after the stay-at-home order and that these variations in exposure density had a direct and measurable impact on the risk of infection. Notably, we find that an additional 10% reduction in exposure density city-wide could have saved between 1,849 and 4,068 lives during the study period, predominantly in lower-income and minority communities."
"During 2008-2015, the estimated annual HIV incidence rate in the United States decreased for each transmission risk category, except for men who have sex with men (MSM). Racial/ethnic disparities exist, with higher incidence rates for Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM.','This analysis examines changes, 2010-2015, in disparities of HIV incidence among Black, Hispanic/Latino and White MSM.','We compared results from the rate ratio, rate difference, weighted and unweighted index of disparity, and population attributable proportion. We calculated incidence rates for MSM using HIV surveillance data and published estimates of the MSM population in the United States. We generated 95% confidence intervals for each measure and used the Z statistic and associated P values to assess statistical significance.','Results from all but one measure, Black-to-White rate difference, indicate that racial/ethnic disparities increased during 2010-2015; not all results were statistically significant. There were statistically significant increases in the Hispanic/Latino-to-White MSM incidence rate ratio (29%, P < 0.05), weighted index of disparity with the rate for White MSM as the referent group (9%, P < 0.05), and the population attributable proportion index (10%, P < 0.05). If racial/ethnic disparities among MSM had been eliminated, a range of 55%-61% decrease in overall MSM HIV incidence would have been achieved during 2010-2015.','A large reduction in overall annual HIV incidence among MSM can be achieved by eliminating racial/ethnic disparities among MSM. Removing social and structural causes of racial/ethnic disparities among MSM can be effective in reducing overall annual HIV incidence among MSM."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity (SMM) are substantial, but little is known about whether these disparities are changing over time or the role of maternal and obstetric factors.','We examined disparities in SMM prevalence and trends using linked birth certificate and delivery discharge records from Californian births during 1997-2014 (n = 8,252,025).','The prevalence of SMM was highest in non-Hispanic (NH) Black women (1.63%), lowest in NH White women (0.84%), and increased from 1997 to 2014 by approximately 170% in each racial/ethnic group. The magnitude of SMM disparities remained consistent over time. Compared with NH White women, the adjusted risk of SMM was higher in women who identified as Hispanic (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.12, 1.16), Asian/Pacific Islander (RR 1.23; 95% CI 1.20, 1.26), NH Black (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.23, 1.31), and American Indian/Alaska Native (RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.15, 1.44), accounting for comorbidities, anemia, cesarean birth, and other maternal characteristics.','The prevalence of SMM varied considerably by race/ethnicity but increased at similarly high rates among all racial/ethnic groups. Comorbidities, cesarean birth, and other factors did not fully explain the disparities in SMM, which remained persistent over time."
"With the advent of new screening technologies, including digital breast tomosynthesis, screening ultrasound, and breast magnetic resonance imaging, there is growing concern that existing disparities among traditionally underserved populations will worsen. These newer screening modalities purport improved cancer detection over mammography alone but are not offered at all screening facilities and often require a larger co-pay or out-of-pocket expense. Thus, the potential for worsening disparities with regard to access and appropriate utilization of supplemental screening technologies exists. Currently, there is a dearth of literature on the topic of health disparities related to access and the use of supplemental breast cancer screening and their impact on outcomes. Identifying and addressing explanatory factors for persistent and potentially worsening disparities remain a central focus of efforts to improve equity in breast cancer care. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of factors that may contribute to present and future disparities in breast cancer screening and outcomes, and explores specific relevant topics requiring greater research efforts as more personalized, multimodality breast cancer screening approaches are adopted into clinical practice."
"Given the growing importance of identifying and reducing health disparities, it is important for radiologist researchers to engage in this space to promote evidence-based imaging disparities policy. However, researchers are often hindered by access to appropriate data to perform quality research.','This paper reviews existing publicly available data sets that may be useful for performing imaging disparities research.','Multiple data sources are publicly available and have been used by previous researchers to examine imaging disparities.','This paper provides an overview of publicly available data sources that radiologists can use for imaging disparities research. Appropriate use of these data sources will require researchers to carefully consider the overall research question and level of analysis."
"Data from the USA reveal disparities in hospitalization and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Social determinants of health (SDoH) could account for disparities in disease incidence and outcomes. We investigated the association between zip code racial composition and COVID-19 incidence and case fatality in Oakland County, MI.','We conducted an ecological study using publicly available data on COVID-19 in 70 zip codes in Oakland County, MI. We obtained demographic surrogate markers of SDoH by zip code from the US Census Bureau website. Using negative binomial regression models, we investigated the association between the percentage of Blacks in each zip code and COVID-19 incidence and case fatality, including markers of SDoH as potential confounders.','Reported COVID-19 cases ranged from 13.2 to 255.2 per 10,000 population. Each percentage increase in Blacks within a zip code was associated with a 3% increase in COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.04, p ≤ 0.0001), and this remained significant after adjusting for income or poverty level, number of persons per household, mode of transportation, age, and level of education (incidence rate ratio: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.03, p ≤ 0.0001). Zip codes with a higher percentage of Blacks also experienced a faster increase in COVID-19 rates from April 3 to May 16. However, the proportion of Blacks in a zip code was not associated with case fatality.','Zip codes with larger Black populations were disproportionately affected by COVID-19."
"<b>Aims</b>: Racial disparities in cancer mortality persist despite rapid developments in cancer treatment strategies. In recent decades, an increased frequency of patients with young-onset cancer has been reported. However, few studies have assessed racial disparities in clinical features and overall survival among young-onset patients with colorectal, breast, and testicular cancer. Therefore, we evaluated racial disparities in cancer mortality for these three cancer types. <b>Methods</b>: We extracted the data of eligible patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database from 1973 to 2014. Overall and cancer-specific survival rates were compared among races using Kaplan-Meier curves. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the association of race with survival was influenced by marital status, surgery and disease stage in Cox proportional hazard models. <b>Results</b>: We collected the data of 19,574 patients with colorectal cancer, 68,733 with breast cancer, and 26,410 with testicular cancer; all were aged 25-40 years. A higher proportion of Blacks presented with a distant stage at diagnosis compared to Whites and Others (colorectal cancer: 18.0%, 18.5% and 18.4%, respectively, P = 0.004; breast cancer: 3.5%, 6.3% and 4.0%, respectively, P < 0.001; testicular cancer: 6.9%, 10.8% and 8.6%, respectively, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that Blacks had the highest overall mortality rate (colorectal cancer, HR, 1.277, 95% CI: 1.198, 1.361, P < 0.001; breast cancer, HR, 1.471, 95% CI: 1.420, 1.525, P < 0.001; testicular cancer, HR, 1.887, 95% CI: 1.562, 2.281, P < 0.001). In stratified analyses, Unmarried Blacks had a higher mortality rates (colorectal cancer, HR, 1.318, 95% CI: 1.211, 1.435, P < 0.001; breast cancer, HR, 1.465, 95% CI: 1.394, 1.541, P < 0.001; testicular cancer, HR, 1.944, 95% CI: 1.544, 2.447, P < 0.001). Furthermore, Blacks with colorectal and breast cancer had a higher risk of mortality than Whites at every disease stage, with greatest disparities occurred among individuals at localized stage. The influence of racial disparities on survival was consistent among patients who accepted surgery, but was weak among those who did not undergo surgery for colorectal cancer (Blacks, HR, 1.027, 95% CI: 0.866, 1.219, P = 0.758; Others, HR, 0.919, 95% CI: 0.760, 1.112, P = 0.386) and testicular cancer (Blacks, HR, 1.039, 95% CI: 0.538, 2.007, P = 0.909; Others, HR, 0.772, 95% CI: 0.388, 1.533, P = 0.459). <b>Conclusions</b>: We demonstrated that Blacks had a worse prognosis for young-onset colorectal, breast, and testicular cancer. Marital status, cancer-directed surgery and disease stage may influence the association of race with the risk of mortality. Equal access to high-quality medical care among races, greater social support and comprehensive interventions are required. Moreover, further studies need to clarify the effects of biological properties like genetic differences between races on cancer patient survival."
"Individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) have worse healthcare access and report lower quality of care compared to individuals who are proficient in English. Policy efforts to improve patient-provider communication for LEP individuals have been going on for decades but linguistic disparities persist.','To describe trends in patient-provider communication by limited English proficiency (LEP) from 2006 to 2015.','We estimated interrupted time series models for three measures of patient-provider communication, testing for differences in both means (intercepts) and trends (slopes) before and after 2010 and differences in differences by English proficiency.','A nationally representative sample of the US non-institutionalized population with at least one office-based medical visit from the 2006-2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (N = 27,001).','Patient-provider communication is measured with three variables indicating whether individuals reported that their providers always explained things in a way that was easy to understand, showed respect for what they had to say, and listened carefully.','Although patient-provider communication improved for all groups over the study period, before 2010, it was getting worse among LEP individuals and disparities in patient-provider communication were widening. After 2010, patient-provider communication improved for LEP individuals and language disparities by English proficiency either narrowed or remained the same. For example, between 2006 and 2010, the percent of LEP individuals reporting that their provider explained things clearly declined by, on average, 1.4 percentage points per year (p value = 0.102); after 2010, it increased by 3.0 percentage points per year (p value = 0.003).','Our study sheds light on trends in patient-provider communication before and after 2010, a year that marked substantial efforts to reform the US healthcare system. Though patient-provider communication among LEP individuals has improved since 2010, linguistic disparities persist and constitute a formidable challenge to achieving healthcare equity, a long-standing US policy goal."
"African American and Hispanic adolescent experience more violence exposure relative to White youth. The present study examined the mediating role of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), delinquency, earlier victimization, and familial and neighborhood factors in disparities in future victimization. The study utilized data from the National Survey of Adolescents-Replication (N = 3,312), which consists of three waves of data collected approximately 1 year apart. A series of path models, tested polyvictimization, PTSS, delinquency, familial socioeconomic factors, and neighborhood safety as mediators of disparities in new polyvictimization. All cross-lagged and autoregressive paths positively predicted past-year polyvictimization and mediated longitudinal disparities. Familial socioeconomic variables and neighborhood safety mediated initial violence exposure disparities. Overall, results indicate that prior violence exposure, related mental health symptoms, and familial and neighborhood factors account for significant portions of disparities in new violence exposure across adolescence."
"There are more than 500 articles in the 2014 race-based healthcare disparities literature across a broad array of diseases and outcomes. However, unlike many other forms of research (e.g., clinical trials and systematic reviews), there are no required reporting guidelines when submitting results of disparities studies to journals.','This study describes the race-based healthcare disparities measurement literature in terms of study design, journal characteristics, generation of health disparities research, type of disparity measure used, and adherence to disparities measurement guidelines.','We searched three databases of peer-reviewed literature, PubMed, Ovid Medline, and JSTOR, for English language articles published in 2014 on racial/ethnic healthcare disparities. Studies must have quantitatively measured the difference in health outcomes between two racial/ethnic groups in order to be included. Our final sample included 266 studies from 167 medical and public health journals.','Only 7 % (n = 19) of articles reported both an absolute and relative measure of disparity; the majority of studies (64 %, n = 171) reported only a relative measure of effect. Most studies were published in clinical journals (74 %, n = 198), used secondary data (86 %, n = 229), and calculated black-white disparities (82 %, n = 218). The most common condition studied was cancer (25 %, n = 67), followed by a surgical procedure (18 %, n = 48). On average, articles in the sample only met 61 % of the applicable guidelines on reporting of disparities.','To be able to synthesize findings in the racial disparities literature (meta-analysis), there is a need for the use of consistent methods for quantifying disparities and reporting in the literature. A more consistent battery of measures and consistent reporting across studies may help speed our understanding of the origins and development of solutions to address healthcare disparities. Despite guidelines for best practices in reporting disparities, there is a lack of adherence in the current literature."
"Electronic patient portal (EPP) use has been associated with a number of benefits in the internal medicine setting. Few studies have examined the disparities in and the benefits of EPP utilization among surgical patients. The purposes of this study were to examine factors associated with EPP use among patients undergoing an orthopaedic surgical procedure and to determine if EPP use is associated with improved outcomes or satisfaction after orthopaedic surgical procedures.','We queried all patients undergoing an orthopaedic surgical procedure from May 2015 to December 2018 at 2 academic medical centers in an integrated hospital system. Patient demographic characteristics, operative characteristics, satisfaction scores, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify disparities in EPP use. Adjusted logistic and linear regressions were then used to assess the association between EPP use and the various outcome metrics while controlling for confounders identified in the previous analysis.','Numerous demographic factors were independently associated with EPP use among patients undergoing an orthopaedic surgical procedure, including English speakers compared with non-English speakers (odds ratio [OR], 2.37 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.01 to 2.79]); African-American or black race (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.48]) and Hispanic race (OR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.61]) compared with white race; college education compared with high school education (OR, 2.30 [95% CI, 2.12 to 2.49]); and a surgical procedure for orthopaedic trauma compared with that for the hand or upper extremity (OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.58]) (p < 0.001 for all), among others. EPP use was independently associated with the increased likelihood of completing a PROM (OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.45 to 1.7]) and a satisfaction survey (OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 2.17 to 2.61]) and improved overall patient satisfaction (mean difference, 2.61 points [95% CI, 1.79 to 3.43 points]) (p < 0.001 for all). Finally, EPP use was independently associated with lower mean no-show rates (6.8% [95% CI, 6.4% to 7.2%] compared with 9.3% [95% CI, 8.9% to 9.7%]). The lower no-show rate for EPP users corresponded to an estimated $218,225 in savings for our institution within the first postoperative year.','This study identified significant disparities in EPP use among patients undergoing an orthopaedic surgical procedure. Given that EPP use was independently associated with lower no-show rates and improved patient satisfaction among patients undergoing an orthopaedic procedure, efforts to reduce these disparities are warranted.','EPPs are increasingly being used by health-care systems to improve communication between providers and patients; however, providers should be aware of and strive to eliminate disparities in EPP utilization among orthopaedic patients. Within orthopaedic surgery, EPPs are associated with a number of benefits, including lower no-show rates and increased patient satisfaction."
"Disparities in the control of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease risk factors are well-documented in the United States, even among patients seen regularly in the healthcare system. Few existing approaches explicitly address disparities in hypertension care and control. This paper describes the RICH LIFE Project (Reducing Inequities in Care of Hypertension: Lifestyle Improvement for Everyone) design.','RICH LIFE is a two-arm, cluster-randomized trial, comparing the effectiveness of enhanced standard of care, ""Standard of Care Plus"" (SCP), to a multi-level intervention, ""Collaborative Care/Stepped Care"" (CC/SC), for improving blood pressure (BP) control and patient activation and reducing disparities in BP control among 1890 adults with uncontrolled hypertension and at least one other cardiovascular disease risk factor treated at 30 primary care practices in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Fifteen practices randomized to the SCP arm receive standardized BP measurement training; race/ethnicity-specific audit and feedback of BP control rates; and quarterly webinars in management practices, quality improvement and disparities reduction. Fifteen practices in the CC/SC arm receive the SCP interventions plus implementation of the collaborative care model with stepped-care components (community health worker referrals and virtual specialist-panel consults). The primary clinical outcome is BP control (<140/90 mm Hg) at 12 months.

"Leaders of health care organizations need to be prepared to improve quality and achieve equity in today's health care environment characterized by a focus on achieving value and addressing disparities in a diverse population. To help address this need, the Disparities Solutions Center at Massachusetts General Hospital launched the Disparities Leadership Program in 2007. The leadership program is an ongoing, year-long, executive education initiative that trains leaders from hospitals, health plans, and health centers to improve quality and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Feedback from participating organizations demonstrates that health care leaders seem to possess knowledge about what disparities are and about what should be done to eliminate them. Data collection, performance measurement, and multifaceted interventions remain the tools of the trade. However, the barriers to success are lack of leadership buy-in, organizational prioritization, energy, and execution, which can be addressed through organizational change management strategies."
"Ethnic minority youth are disproportionately affected by substance use-related consequences, which may be best understood through a social ecological lens. Differences in psychosocial consequences between ethnic majority and minority groups are likely due to underlying social and environmental factors. The current longitudinal study examined the outcomes of a school-based motivational enhancement treatment intervention in reducing disparities in substance use consequences experienced by some ethnic minority groups with both between and within-subjects differences. Students were referred to the intervention through school personnel and participated in a four-session intervention targeting alcohol and drug use. Participants included 122 youth aged 13-19 years. Participants were grouped by ethnicity and likelihood of disparate negative consequences of substance use. African American/Hispanic/Multiethnic youth formed one group, and youth identifying as White or Asian formed a second group. We hypothesized that (1) there would be significant disparities in psychosocial, serious problem behavior, and school-based consequences of substance use between White/Asian students compared to African American/Hispanic/Multiethnic students at baseline; (2) physical dependence consequences would not be disparate at baseline; and (3) overall disparities would be reduced at post-treatment follow-up. Results indicated that African American/Hispanic/Multiethnic adolescents demonstrated statistically significant disparate consequences at baseline, except for physical dependency consequences. Lastly, significant reductions in disparities were evidenced between groups over time. Our findings highlight the efficacy of utilizing school-based substance use interventions in decreasing ethnic health disparities in substance use consequences."
"Racial disparities have been demonstrated in many facets of health care, but a comprehensive understanding of who is most at risk for substandard surgical care of gastrointestinal tract cancers is lacking.','To examine racial disparities in quality of care of patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers.','This retrospective cohort study of patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer included the US population as captured in the National Cancer Database with a diagnosis from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2017. Participants included 565 124 adults who underwent surgical resection of gastrointestinal tract cancers. Data were analyzed from June 21 to December 23, 2021.','Race and site of cancer.','Oncologic standard of care, as defined by negative resection margin, adequate lymphadenectomy, and receipt of indicated adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.','Among 565 124 adult patients who underwent surgical resection of a gastrointestinal tract cancer, 10.9% were Black patients, 83.5% were White patients, 54.7% were men, and 50.7% had Medicare coverage. The most common age range at diagnosis was 60 to 69 years (28.5%). Longer median survival was associated with negative resection margins (87.3 [IQR, 28.5-161.9] months vs 22.9 [IQR, 8.8-69.2] months; P < .001) and adequate lymphadenectomies (80.7 [IQR, 25.6 to not reached] months vs 57.6 [IQR, 17.7-153.8] months; P < .001). After adjustment for covariates, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have negative surgical margins overall (odds ratio [OR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98]) and after esophagectomy (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.58-0.87]), proctectomy (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.66-0.76]), and biliary resection (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.91]).

Black patients were more likely than White patients not to be recommended for chemotherapy (OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.10-1.21]) and radiotherapy (OR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.35-1.64]) because of comorbidities and more likely not to receive recommended chemotherapy (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.55-1.82]) and radiotherapy (OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.97-2.41]) for unknown reasons.','These findings suggest that there are significant racial disparities in surgical care of gastrointestinal tract cancers. Black patients are less likely than White patients to receive standard of care with respect to negative surgical margins, adequate lymphadenectomies, and use of adjuvant therapies. Both system- and physician-level reforms are needed to eradicate these disparities in health care."
"This review will explore the underlying causes of healthcare disparities among trauma patients and offer considerations for reducing inequities to improve trauma care.','Newly recognized racial disparities exist with respect to triaging trauma patients and in acute pain management. Social Determinants of Health offers a model to understand disparity in trauma care.','Race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare drive outcome disparity among trauma patients.

"Cancer death rates vary among population groups. Underserved populations continue to experience an excessive burden of lethal cancers that is largely explained by health-care disparities. However, the prominent role of advanced-stage disease as a driver of cancer survival disparities may indicate that some cancers are more aggressive in certain population groups than others. The tumor mutational burden can show large differences among patients with similar-stage disease but differences in race/ethnicity or residence. These dissimilarities may result from environmental or chronic inflammatory exposures, altering tumor biology and the immune response. We discuss the evidence that inflammation and immune response dissimilarities among population groups contribute to cancer disparities and how they can be targeted to reduce these disparities."
"Understanding racial and ethnic disparities in diagnostic rates of genetic testing is critical for health equity. We sought to understand the extent and cause of racial and ethnic disparities in diagnostic efficacy of comprehensive genetic testing (CGT) for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). We performed a retrospective cohort study at two tertiary children's hospitals on a diverse cohort of 240 consecutive pediatric patients (76% publicly insured, 82% non-White) with SNHL of unknown etiology who underwent CGT. Definite and possible genetic diagnoses were assigned for each patient, representing the likelihood of a genetic cause of hearing loss. Associations between diagnostic rates were examined. 3.8 ± 2.1 variants were detected per patient; this frequency did not vary between White/Asian and Hispanic/Black cohorts. Overall, 82% of variants were variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Compared with White and Asian subjects, variants identified among Hispanic and Black children were less likely to be classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic (15% vs. 24%, p < 0.001), and Hispanic and Black children were less likely to have a definite genetic diagnosis (10% vs. 37%, p < 0.001). The adjusted odds ratio for definite genetic diagnosis in Black and Hispanic children compared with White and Asian children was 0.19. Expanding genetic diagnostic criteria to include predicted deleterious VUSs reduced these disparities between White/Asian and Hispanic/Black children, with comparable molecular diagnostic rates (41% vs. 38%, p = 0.72). However, in silico predictions are insufficiently valid for clinical use. Increased inclusion of underrepresented groups in genetic hearing-loss studies to clinically validate these variants is necessary to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in diagnostic efficacy of comprehensive genetic testing."
"Disparities in infertility and access to infertility treatments, such as assisted reproductive technology (ART), by race/ethnicity, have been reported. However, identifying disparities in ART usage may have been hampered by missing race/ethnicity information in ART surveillance. We review infertility prevalence and treatment disparities, use recent data to examine ART use in the United States by race/ethnicity and residency in states with mandated insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF), and discuss approaches for reducing disparities. We used 2014 National ART Surveillance System (NASS) data to calculate rates of ART procedures per million women 15-44 years of age, a proxy measure of ART utilization, for Census-defined racial/ethnic groups in the United States; rates were further stratified by the presence of insurance mandates for IVF treatment. Missing race/ethnicity data (35.6% of cycles) were imputed. Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI) women had the highest rates of ART utilization at 5883 ART procedures per million women 15-44 years of age in 2014, whereas American Indian/Alaska Native non-Hispanic women had the lowest rates at 807 per million, compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In each racial/ethnic category, ART utilization rates were higher for women in states with an insurance mandate for IVF treatment versus those without. In 2014, A/PI women had the highest rates of ART utilization. ART utilization for all racial/ethnic groups was higher in states with insurance mandates for IVF than those without, although disparities were still evident. Although mandates may increase access to infertility treatments, they are not sufficient to eliminate these disparities."
"Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an effective way to address cancer disparities in medically underserved populations. Our research demonstrates how CBPR principles were used to develop lung cancer and risk factor mini reports for a network of community coalitions in the Illinois Delta Region, a predominately rural region with high lung cancer disparities in southern Illinois. An academic-community partnership, including a community-based medical school, state public health department, and a healthcare system, used CBPR principles to translate epidemiological, behavioral, and demographic data into understandable, comprehensive, yet concise mini reports for each coalition. A cyclical and iterative process was used to draft, revise, and optimize these mini reports to raise awareness about lung cancer disparities in the community and to provide information to help guide the development of interventions that address these disparities. The use of CBPR principles was a successful way to create mini reports about local lung cancer disparities and risk factors that were usable in individual communities. Local coalitions used the mini reports to educate community members at local meetings, to guide strategic planning, and to disseminate information through their respective websites. Additionally, the process of creating these reports built trust among academic-community partners and provided additional avenues of engagement, such as the involvement of an academic partner in the strategic planning process of a local coalition. Using CBPR processes is an effective way to translate epidemiological data into a community-friendly format to address cancer disparities."
"Palliative care (PC) is recommended for gynecological cancer patients to improve survival and quality-of-life. Our objective was to evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in PC utilization among patients with metastatic gynecologic cancer.','We used data from the 2016 National Cancer Database (NCDB) and included patients between ages 18-90 years with metastatic (stage III-IV) gynecologic cancers including, ovarian, cervical and uterine cancer who were deceased at last contact or follow-up (n = 124,729). PC was defined by NCDB as non-curative treatment, and could include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and pain management or any combination. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate racial disparities in PC use.','The study population was primarily NH-White (74%), ovarian cancer patients (74%), insured by Medicare (47%) or privately insured (36%), and had a Charlson-Deyo score of zero (77%). Over one-third of patients were treated at a comprehensive community cancer program. Overall, 7% of metastatic gynecologic deceased cancer patients based on last follow-up utilized palliative care: more specifically, 5% of ovarian, 11% of cervical, and 12% of uterine metastatic cancer patients. Palliative care utilization increased over time starting at 4% in 2004 to as high as 13% in 2015, although palliative care use decreased to 7% in 2016. Among metastatic ovarian cancer patients, NH-Black (aOR:0.87, 95% CI:0.78-0.97) and Hispanic patients (aOR:0.77, 95% CI:0.66-0.91) were less likely to utilize PC when compared to NH-White patients. Similarly, Hispanic cervical cancer patients were less likely (aOR:0.75, 95% CI:0.63-0.88) to utilize PC when compared to NH-White patients.','PC is highly underutilized among metastatic gynecological cancer patients. Racial disparities exist in palliative care utilization among patients with metastatic gynecological cancer."
"Solitary confinement is still used in prisons in the USA, despite its links to poor health. Past research suggests that there may be disparities by race, ethnicity, sex and mental disorders regarding who is placed in solitary confinement, although nationwide studies have been sparse.','To explore possible disparities by race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, adverse childhood experiences and mental disorders in solitary confinement as a disciplinary action for adults incarcerated in USA prisons.','Data come from a recently released national survey of 24,848 adults incarcerated in the USA-the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates.

More effective implementation of policies to reduce the use of solitary confinement are still needed. Mental health professionals should have an active role in advising on measures when mental disorder is a factor and must ensure adequate treatment of disorders in prison or transfer to health facilities."
"The largest US cancer health disparity exists in prostate cancer, with Black men having more than a two-fold increased risk of dying from prostate cancer compared to all other races. This disparity is a result of a complex network of factors including socioeconomic status (SES), environmental exposures, and genetics/biology. Inequity in the US healthcare system has emerged as a major driver of disparity in prostate cancer outcomes and has raised concerns that the actual incidence rates may be higher than current estimates. However, emerging studies argue that equalizing healthcare access will not fully eliminate racial health disparities and highlight the important role of biology. Significant differences have been observed in prostate cancer biology between ancestral groups that may contribute to prostate cancer health disparities. Notably, relative to White men, Black men with prostate cancer exhibit increased androgen receptor signaling, genomic instability, metabolic dysregulation, and inflammatory and cytokine signaling. Immediate actions are needed to increase multi-center, interdisciplinary research to bridge the gap between social and biological determinants of prostate cancer health disparities."
"The impact of the social determinants of health on healthcare utilization for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains incompletely characterized.','We queried the National Health Interview Survey from 2000-2018 to examine disparities in healthcare utilization metrics by education, income-to-poverty ratio, and health insurance coverage for adults with self-reported ASCVD.','We show that, while education and income-to-poverty ratios demonstrated significant disparities for provider visits and preventive screenings, the largest disparities were noted for health insurance coverage.','These trends suggest that efforts to expand private or government insurance to improve coverage for patients with ASCVD may address healthcare utilization-based disparities."
"Excessive environmental noise exposure and noise annoyance have been linked to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Although socioeconomic disparities in acoustically measured and geospatially estimated noise have been established, less is known about disparities in noise complaints, one of the most common sources of distress reported to local municipalities. Furthermore, although some studies have posited urban quieting during the COVID-19 pandemic, little empirical work has probed this and probed noise complaints during the pandemic.','Using over 4 million noise complaints from the New York City (NYC) 311 database, we quantified census tract-level socioeconomic disparities in noise complaints since 2010 and examined how such disparities changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.','Using data from January 2010 through February 2020, we fit linear mixed-effects models, estimating monthly tract-level noise complaints by the proportion of residents who were low-income, time in months since January 2010, categorical month, their interactions, and potential confounds, such as total population and population density. To estimate COVID-19 pandemic effects, we included additional data from March 2020 through February 2021 and additional interactions between proportion low-income, month of year, and an indicator variable for COVID-19 pandemic onset in March 2020.','Census tracts with a higher proportion of low-income residents reported more monthly noise complaints and this increased over time (time × month × proportion low-income interaction p-values < .0001 for all months), particularly in warmer months. Socioeconomic disparities in noise complaints were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic (month × proportion low-income × pandemic era interaction p-values < .0001 for March through November), also in a seasonal manner.','Since 2010, noise complaints have increased the most in the most economically distressed communities, particularly in warmer seasons. This disparity was particularly exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, contrary to some theories of urban quieting. Community-based interventions to ameliorate noise and noise annoyance, both public health hazards, are needed in underserved communities."
"Retrospective.','The purpose of this study was to assess trends in utilization rates of adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery, as well as perioperative surgical metrics between Black and White patients undergoing operative treatment for ASD in the United States.','Racial disparities in access to care, complications, and surgical selection have been shown to exist in the field of spine surgery. However, there is a paucity of data concerning racial disparities in the management of ASD patients.','Adult patients undergoing ASD surgery from 2004 to 2014 were identified in the nationwide inpatient sample (NIS). Utilization rates, major complications rates, and length of stay (LOS) for Black patients and White patients were trended over time. Utilization rates were reported per 1,000,000 people and determined using annual census data among subpopulations stratified by race. All reported complication rates and prolonged hospital stay rates are adjusted for Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, income quartile by zip code, and insurance payer status.','From 2004 to 2014, ASD utilization for Black patients increased from 24.0 to 50.9 per 1,000,000 people, whereas ASD utilization for White patients increased from 29.9 to 73.1 per 1,000,000 people, indicating a significant increase in racial disparities in ASD utilization (P-trend < 0.001). There were no significant differences in complication rates or rates of prolonged hospital stay between Black and White patients across the time period studied (P > 0.05 for both).','Although Black and White patients undergoing ASD surgery do not differ significantly in terms of postoperative complications and length of hospital stay, there is a growing disparity in utilization of ASD surgery between White and Black patients from 2004 to 2014 in the United States. There is need for continued focus on identifying ways to reduce racial disparities in surgical selection and perioperative management in spine deformity surgery.Level of Evidence: 3."
"Women with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in the USA are bearing children at increasing rates. However, very little is known whether racial and ethnic disparities in birth outcomes and labour and delivery-related charges exist in this population. This study investigated racial and ethnic disparities in birth outcomes and labour and delivery-related charges among women with IDD.','The study employed secondary analysis of the 2004-2011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer, publicly available US inpatient healthcare database. Hierarchical mixed-effect logistic and linear regression models were used to compare the study outcomes.','We identified 2110 delivery-associated hospitalisations among women with IDD including 1275 among non-Hispanic White women, 527 among non-Hispanic Black women and 308 among Hispanic women. We found significant disparities in stillbirth among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women with IDD compared with their non-Hispanic White peers [odds ratio = 2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-5.28, P < 0.01 and odds ratio = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.08-5.92, P < 0.01, respectively]. There were no racial and ethnic disparities in caesarean delivery, preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age neonates among women with IDD. The average labour and delivery-related charges for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Women with IDD ($18 889 and $22 481, respectively) exceeded those for non-Hispanic White women with IDD ($14 886) by $4003 and $7595 or by 27% and 51%, respectively. The significant racial and ethnic differences in charges persisted even after controlling for a range of individual-level and institutional-level characteristics and were 6% (ln(β) = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01-0.11, P < 0.05) and 9% (ln(β) = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03-0.14, P < 0.01) higher for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Women with IDD compared with non-Hispanic White women with IDD.','Our findings highlight the need for an integrated approach to the delivery of comprehensive perinatal services for racial and ethnic minority women with IDD to reduce their risk of having a stillbirth. Additionally, further research is needed to examine the causes of racial and ethnic disparities in hospital charges for labour and delivery admission among women with IDD and ascertain whether price discrimination exists based on patients' racial or ethnic identities."
"Socioeconomic determinants of health are associated with worse outcomes in the rheumatic diseases and contribute significantly to health disparities. However, genetic and epigenetic risk factors may affect different populations disproportionally and further exacerbate health disparities. We discuss the role of genetics and epigenetics to the health disparities observed in rheumatic diseases. We review concepts of population genetics and natural selection, current genome-wide genetic and epigenetic studies of several autoimmune diseases, and environmental exposures associated with disease risk in different populations. To understand how genomics influence health disparities in the rheumatic diseases, further studies in different populations worldwide are needed."
"Prior research has highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in H1N1 vaccination in the United States. Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites).','Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare.','Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4%), followed by white males (26.3%), black males (21.6%), and black females (17.5%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35-45% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations.','The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages."
"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread social, psychological, and economic impacts. However, these impacts are not distributed equally: already marginalized populations, specifically racial/ethnic minority groups and sexual and gender minority populations, may be more likely to suffer the effects of COVID-19. The COVID-19 Resiliency Survey was conducted by the city of Chicago to assess the impact of COVID-19 on city residents in the wake of Chicago's initial lockdown, with particular focus on the experiences of minority populations. Chi-square tests of independence were performed to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and impacts on heterosexual vs. sexual minority populations, cisgender vs. gender minority populations, and White vs. racial/ethnic minority subgroups. Marginalized populations experienced significant disparities in COVID-19 exposure, susceptibility, and treatment access, as well as in psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Notably, Black and Latinx populations reported significant difficulties accessing food and supplies (p = 0.002). Healthcare access disparities were also visible, with Black and Latinx respondents reporting significantly lower levels of access to a provider to see if COVID-19 testing would be appropriate (p = 0.013), medical services (p = 0.001), and use of telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.001). Sexual minority respondents reported significantly lower rates of using telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.011), and gender minority respondents reported significantly lower levels of primary care provider access (p = 0.016). There are evident COVID-19 disparities experienced in Chicago especially for Black, Latinx, sexual minority, and gender minority groups. A greater focus must be paid to health equity, including providing increased resources and supplies for affected groups, adapting to inequities in the built environment, and ensuring adequate access to healthcare services to ameliorate the burden of COVID-19 on these marginalized populations."
"Gallbladder cancer is a rare malignancy, yet it has a dismal prognosis. Overall survival has improved in all races/ethnicities except Hispanics and blacks. Despite improvements in gallbladder cancer management, it is not clear whether racial/ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis and treatments exist that could potentially be the source of survival disparities. The purpose of this study was to examine race/ethnicity-specific trends in the stage of disease and receipt of treatments among adult gallbladder cancer patients in the US.','Using the 2000-2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries in the US. Race/ethnicity-specific cancer stage at diagnosis and treatments received among adults with gallbladder cancer were evaluated. Differences in gallbladder cancer stage at presentation, treatment modalities and number of lymph nodes (LN) removed among each race/ethnicity were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models.','A total of 7,507 patients with gallbladder cancer were included. There were no racial/ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis. With regard to disparities in treatments, blacks were significantly less likely to receive curative surgery compared to whites [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.80; P<0.001]. No racial/ethnic disparities in radiation therapy were observed. In patients undergoing curative surgery, Hispanics were significantly less likely to have optimal LN clearance compared to whites (AOR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47-0.74; P<0.001). After stratification into 2-time periods (2000 to 2006 and 2007 to 2013), racial/ethnic disparities in treatments seemed to be more pronounced over time.','Among US adults with gallbladder cancer, no racial/ethnic disparities in stage at diagnosis were observed. However, blacks, and Hispanics were less likely to receive curative surgery, and optimal LN clearance than Whites, which are consistent with the lack of survival improvements in those groups and they should be target groups for future studies to address treatment disparities."
"Trends in cardiovascular disparities are poorly understood, even as diversity increases in the United States.','To examine U.S. trends in racial/ethnic and nativity disparities in cardiovascular health.','Repeated cross-sectional study.','NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), 1988 to 2014.','Adults aged 25 years or older who did not report cardiovascular disease.','Racial/ethnic, nativity, and period differences in Life's Simple 7 (LS7) health factors and behaviors (blood pressure, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, physical activity, diet, and smoking) and optimal composite scores for cardiovascular health (LS7 score ≥10).','Rates of optimal cardiovascular health remain below 40% among whites, 25% among Mexican Americans, and 15% among African Americans. Disparities in optimal cardiovascular health between whites and African Americans persisted but decreased over time. In 1988 to 1994, the percentage of African Americans with optimal LS7 scores was 22.8 percentage points (95% CI, 19.3 to 26.4 percentage points) lower than that of whites in persons aged 25 to 44 years and 8.0 percentage points (CI, 6.4 to 9.7 percentage points) lower in those aged 65 years or older. By 2011 to 2014, differences decreased to 10.6 percentage points (CI, 7.4 to 13.9 percentage points) and 3.8 percentage points (CI, 2.5 to 5.0 percentage points), respectively. Disparities in optimal LS7 scores between whites and Mexican Americans were smaller but also decreased. These decreases were due to reductions in optimal cardiovascular health among whites over all age groups and periods: Between 1988 to 1994 and 2011 to 2014, the percentage of whites with optimal cardiovascular health decreased 15.3 percentage points (CI, 11.1 to 19.4 percentage points) for those aged 25 to 44 years and 4.6 percentage points (CI, 2.7 to 6.5 percentage points) for those aged 65 years or older.','Only whites, African Americans, and Mexican Americans were studied.','Cardiovascular health has declined in the United States, racial/ethnic and nativity disparities persist, and decreased disparities seem to be due to worsening cardiovascular health among whites rather than gains among African Americans and Mexican Americans. Multifaceted interventions are needed to address declining population health and persistent health disparities.','National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health."
"In the United States, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disproportionately impacts racial/ethnic minorities. We describe and evaluate trends in the Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities of new AIDS diagnoses from 1984 to 2013 in the United States.','AIDS diagnosis rates by race/ethnicity for people ≥13 years were calculated using national HIV surveillance and Census data. Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities were measured as rate ratios. Joinpoint Regression was used to identify time periods across which to estimate rate-ratio trends. We calculated the estimated annual percent change in disparities for each time period using log-normal linear regression modeling.','Black-White disparity increased from 1984 to 1990, followed by a large increase from 1991 to 1996, and a smaller increase from 1997 to 2001. Black-White disparity moderated from 2002 to 2005 and rose again from 2006 to 2013. Hispanic-White disparity increased from 1984 to 1997 but declined after 1998. Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities increased for men who have sex with men during 2008 to 2013.','Recent increases in racial/ethnic disparities of AIDS diagnoses were observed and may be due in part to care continuum inequalities. We suggest assessing disparities in AIDS diagnoses as a high-level measure to capture changes at multiple stages of the care continuum collectively. Future research should examine determinants of racial/ethnic differences at each step of the continuum to better identify characteristics driving disparities."
"Differences in local organ supply and demand have introduced geographic inequities in the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score-based liver allocation system, prompting national debate and patient-initiated lawsuits. No study to our knowledge has quantified the sex disparities in allocation associated with clinical vs geographic characteristics.','To estimate the proportion of sex disparity in wait list mortality and deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) associated with clinical and geographic characteristics.','This retrospective cohort study used adult (age ≥18 years) liver-only transplant listings reported to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network from June 18, 2013, through March 1, 2018.','Liver transplant waiting list.','Primary outcomes included wait list mortality and DDLT. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed, and inverse odds ratio weighting was used to estimate the proportion of disparity across geographic location, MELD score, and candidate anthropometric and liver measurements.','Among 81 357 adults wait-listed for liver transplant only, 36.1% were women (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [11.3] years; interquartile range, 49.0-63.0 years) and 63.9% were men (mean [SD] age, 55.7 [10.1] years; interquartile range, 51.0-63.0 years). Compared with men, women were 8.6% more likely to die while on the waiting list (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18) and were 14.4% less likely to receive a DDLT (aHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.84-0.88). In the geographic domain, organ procurement organization was the only variable that was significantly associated with increased disparity between female sex and wait list mortality (22.1% increase; aHR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09-1.30); no measure of the geographic domain was associated with DDLT. Laboratory and allocation MELD scores were associated with increases in disparities in wait list mortality: 1.14 (95% CI, 1.09-1.19; 50.1% increase among women) and DDLT: 0.87 (95% CI, 0.86-0.88; 10.3% increase among women). Candidate anthropometric and liver measurements had the strongest association with disparities between men and women in wait list mortality (125.8% increase among women) and DDLT (49.0% increase among women).','Our findings suggest that addressing geographic disparities alone may not mitigate sex-based disparities, which were associated with the inability of the MELD score to accurately estimate disease severity in women and to account for candidate anthropometric and liver measurements in this study."
"The United States healthcare system underperforms in healthcare access, quality, and cost resulting in some of the poorest health outcomes among comparable countries, despite spending more of its gross national product on healthcare than any other country in the world. Within the United States, there are significant healthcare disparities based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education level, sexual orientation, gender identity, and geographic location. COVID-19 has illuminated the racial disparities in health outcomes. This article provides an overview of some of the main concepts related to health disparities generally, and in orthopaedics specifically. It provides an introduction to health equity terminology, issues of bias and equity, and potential interventions to achieve equity and social justice by addressing commonly asked questions and then introduces the reader to persistent orthopaedic health disparities specific to total hip and total knee arthroplasty."
"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and asexual adolescents are at increased risk of poor mental health outcomes but it remains unknown whether this disparity emerges from early childhood and through to adolescence. This study tested sexual orientation disparities in the developmental trajectories of emotional and behavioral difficulties from ages 5 to 14 years, and the influence of early life adversities upon them.','The Millennium Cohort Study, a British birth cohort, was used (4,838 boys and 5,016 girls). Parent-report emotional and behavioral difficulties at ages 5, 7, 11, and 14 were measured using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Sexual orientation was measured via sexual attraction at age 17. Early life adversities in the first 5 years of life, including parental age at birth, birthweight, duration of breastfeeding, parent-child relationship quality, and parental absence, were collected prospectively.','Latent growth modeling suggested that, for both sexes, sexual orientation disparities in emotional and behavioral difficulties increased from age 5 to 14 years. Homosexual and bisexual girls displayed significantly greater emotional and behavioral difficulties than heterosexual girls at ages 7, 11, and 14. Homosexual and bisexual boys displayed significantly greater emotional and behavioral difficulties than heterosexual boys at ages 11 and 14. Asexual boys and girls displayed significantly greater emotional and behavioral difficulties than their heterosexual counterparts at all four ages. For both sexes, sexual orientation disparities in emotional and behavioral difficulties only reduced slightly in magnitude after controlling for early life adversities.','Sexual minority disparities in emotional and behavioral difficulties increased from childhood to early adolescence, possibly due to the accumulation of susceptibility to minority-related stressors. Sex and early life adversity may contribute to these developmental disparities."
"To quantify nationwide disparities in the location of particulate matter (PM)-emitting facilities by the characteristics of the surrounding residential population and to illustrate various spatial scales at which to consider such disparities.','We assigned facilities emitting PM in the 2011 National Emissions Inventory to nearby block groups across the 2009 to 2013 American Community Survey population. We calculated the burden from these emissions for racial/ethnic groups and by poverty status. We quantified disparities nationally and for each state and county in the country.','For PM of 2.5 micrometers in diameter or less, those in poverty had 1.35 times higher burden than did the overall population, and non-Whites had 1.28 times higher burden. Blacks, specifically, had 1.54 times higher burden than did the overall population. These patterns were relatively unaffected by sensitivity analyses, and disparities held not only nationally but within most states and counties as well.','Disparities in burden from PM-emitting facilities exist at multiple geographic scales. Disparities for Blacks are more pronounced than are disparities on the basis of poverty status. Strictly socioeconomic considerations may be insufficient to reduce PM burdens equitably across populations."
"The growing nurse practitioner (NP) workforce represents a significant supply of primary care providers, who if optimally utilized, are well-positioned to improve access to health care for racial and ethnic minorities. However, many barriers affect the optimal utilization of NPs in primary care delivery. These barriers may also prevent NPs from maximally contributing to efforts to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities. Our review of the empirical and health policy literature sought to elucidate factors that affect NPs' potential and ability to narrow or eliminate health disparities. We found that restrictive state scope of practice regulations, disparate reimbursement policies, lack of NP workforce diversity, and poor organizational structures in NP practices may limit NPs' contributions to current efforts to reduce disparities. Our results led to the development of the nurse practitioner health disparities model which identifies barriers to and opportunities for optimal use of NPs in reducing racial and ethnic disparities. State and federal policymakers and administrators in health-care settings should take actions to remove legislative and organizational barriers to enable NPs to deliver high-quality care to racial and ethnic minorities. Researchers can use the nurse practitioner health disparities model to produce empirical evidence to reduce health disparities and improve population health."
"Racial and ethnic differences in breast cancer occur by race/ethnicity in both incidence and mortality rates. Women of lower socioeconomic status likewise have poorer outcomes. When race alone is considered, incidence rates in the United States are highest among White women (130.8 per 100,000), with Black women close behind (126.7 per 100,000). Incidence is lowest among Asian/Pacific Islander women, at 93.2 per 100,000. Mortality differences are more pronounced, with Black women 40% more likely to die from breast cancer than White women (28.4 per 100,000 and 20.3 per 100,000, respectively). Mortality rates for Asian/Pacific Islander women (11.5 per 100,000) are far lower than for Black and White women. When age is considered, additional differences between Black and White women appear, in part accounted for by types of breast cancer experienced. Women of other racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic status have received less scientific attention. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the evidence for social determinants of breast cancer and argue that the current reliance on race over racism and ethnicity contributes to our inability to eliminate breast cancer disparities in the United States and elsewhere in the world. We suggest alternatives to the current approach to research in breast cancer disparities."
"The objective of this study was to investigate potential county-level disparities among racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States in 100,000 population.','Secondary data analysis using county-level data for 3,142 US counties was conducted in 2020. Hierarchical linear regression and concentration curve analyses were performed. The combined association of COVID-19 cases and deaths was examined separately by the county population's socioeconomic characteristics. Data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2014-2018), Area Health Resources File (AHRF) 2018-2019, Kaiser Health News 2020, and 2020 COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University were used in this study.','After adjusting for covariates, U.S. counties with a higher proportion of the Black population and a higher proportion of adults with less than a high school diploma had disproportionately higher COVID-19 cases and deaths (β > 0, <i>p</i><0.05 for all relations). A higher proportion of the Hispanic population was associated with higher confirmed cases (β = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48-0.87). The majority observed disparities in COVID-19 deaths persisted even after controlling for all-cause deaths in 2019 and COVID-19 cases per 100,000 county population. This can potentially aggravate the existing health disparities among these population groups.','Identification of disproportionately impacted population groups can pave the way towards narrowing the disparity gaps and guide policymakers and stakeholders in designing and implementing population group-specific interventions to mitigate the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Background The incidence of cardiovascular disease among pregnant women is rising in the United States. Data on racial disparities for the major cardiovascular events during pregnancy are limited. Methods and Results Pregnant and post-partum women hospitalized from January 2007 to December 2017 were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The outcomes of interest included: in-hospital mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and peripartum cardiomyopathy. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the independent association between race and in-hospital outcomes. Among 46 700 637 pregnancy-related hospitalizations, 21 663 575 (46.4%) were White, 6 302 089 (13.5%) were Black, and 8 914 065 (19.1%) were Hispanic. The trends of mortality and stroke declined significantly in Black women, but however, were mostly unchanged among White women. The incidence of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity was highest among Black women followed by White women, then Hispanic women. The majority of Blacks (62.3%) were insured by Medicaid while the majority of White patients had private insurance (61.9%). Most of Black women were below-median income (71.2%) while over half of the White patients were above the median income (52.7%). Compared with White women, Black women had the highest mortality with adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.45, 95% CI (1.21-1.73); myocardial infarction with aOR of 1.23, 95% CI (1.06-1.42); stroke with aOR of 1.57, 95% CI (1.41-1.74); pulmonary embolism with aOR of 1.42, 95% CI (1.30-1.56); and peripartum cardiomyopathy with aOR of 1.71, 95 % CI (1.66-1.76). Conclusions Significant racial disparities exist in major cardiovascular events among pregnant and post-partum women. Further efforts are needed to minimize these differences."
"The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting a disproportionate impact on minorities in terms of infection rate, hospitalizations, and mortality. Many believe artificial intelligence (AI) is a solution to guide clinical decision-making for this novel disease, resulting in the rapid dissemination of underdeveloped and potentially biased models, which may exacerbate the disparities gap. We believe there is an urgent need to enforce the systematic use of reporting standards and develop regulatory frameworks for a shared COVID-19 data source to address the challenges of bias in AI during this pandemic. There is hope that AI can help guide treatment decisions within this crisis; yet given the pervasiveness of biases, a failure to proactively develop comprehensive mitigation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic risks exacerbating existing health disparities."
"To examine the importance of distinguishing between primary and secondary racial identification in analyzing health disparities in a multiracial population.','A cross-sectional analysis of 2012 Hawaii Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (H-BRFSS). As part of the survey, respondents were asked to identify all their races, and then which race they considered to be their primary race. We introduce two analytic approaches to investigate the association between multiracial status and general health: (1) including two separate dichotomous variables for each racial group (primary and secondary race; for example, 'primary Native Hawaiian' and, separately, 'secondary Native Hawaiian'), and (2) including one combined variable for anyone choosing a particular racial group, whether as primary or secondary race ('combined race'; e.g. Native Hawaiian). Linear regression then compares the multiracial health disparities identified by the two approaches, adjusted for age and gender.','The 2012 H-BRFSS had 7582 respondents. The four most common self-identified primary racial/ethnic groups were White, Japanese, Filipino, and Native Hawaiian. Native Hawaiians were the largest multiracial group with over 80% self-identifying as multiracial. Health disparities for Native Hawaiians, Portuguese and Puerto Ricans were attenuated by 10% after accounting for multiracial status. Populations that self-identified secondarily as Japanese, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and other PI had significantly poorer self-reported health.','The analysis illustrates the importance of accounting for multiracial populations in health disparities research and demonstrates the ability of two approaches to identify multiracial health disparities in data sets with limited sample sizes. The 'primary and secondary race' approach might work particularly well for a multicultural population like Hawaii."
"Previous studies have identified disparities in readmissions among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program's (HRRP's) priority conditions. Evidence suggests timely follow-up is associated with reduced risk of readmission, but it is unknown whether timely follow-up reduces disparities in readmission.','To assess whether follow-up within 7 days after discharge from a hospitalization reduces risk of readmission and mitigates identified readmission disparities.','A retrospective cohort study using Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the associations between sociodemographic characteristics (race and ethnicity, dual-eligibility status, rurality, and area social deprivation), follow-up, and readmission. Mediation analysis was used to examine if disparities in readmission were mitigated by follow-up.','We analyzed data from 749,402 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, or pneumonia, and discharged home between January 1 and December 1, 2018.','All-cause unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge.','Post-discharge follow-up within 7 days of discharge was associated with a substantially lower risk of readmission (HR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53). Across all four HRRP conditions, beneficiaries with dual eligibility and beneficiaries living in areas with high social deprivation had a higher risk of readmission. Non-Hispanic Black beneficiaries had higher risk of readmission after hospitalization for pneumonia relative to non-Hispanic Whites. Mediation analysis suggested that 7-day follow-up mediated 21.2% of the disparity in the risk of readmission between dually and non-dually eligible beneficiaries and 50.7% of the disparity in the risk of readmission between beneficiaries living in areas with the highest and lowest social deprivation. Analysis suggested that after hospitalization for pneumonia, 7-day follow-up mediated nearly all (97.5%) of the increased risk of readmission between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White beneficiaries.','Improving rates of follow-up could be a strategy to reduce readmissions for all beneficiaries and reduce disparities in readmission based on sociodemographic characteristics."
"Factors contributing to racial and ethnic disparities in medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) receipt during pregnancy are largely unknown. We quantified the contribution of individual, healthcare access and quality, and community factors to racial-ethnic disparities in MOUD during pregnancy and postpartum among Medicaid-enrolled pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD).','This retrospective cohort study used regression and nonlinear decomposition to examine how individual, healthcare access and quality, and community factors explain racial-ethnic disparities in MOUD receipt among Medicaid-enrolled women with OUD who had a live birth from 2011 to 2017. The exposure was self-reported race and ethnicity. The outcomes were any MOUD receipt during pregnancy or postpartum. All factors included were identified from the literature.','Racial-ethnic disparities in individual, healthcare access and quality, and community factors explained 15.8% of the racial-ethnic disparity in MOUD receipt during pregnancy and 68.9% of the disparity in the postpartum period. Despite comparable healthcare utilization, non-White/Hispanic women were diagnosed with OUD 37 days later in pregnancy, on average, than non-Hispanic White women, which was the largest contributor to the racial-ethnic disparity in MOUD receipt during pregnancy (111.0%). The racial-ethnic disparity in MOUD receipt during pregnancy was the largest contributor (112.2%) to the racial-ethnic disparity in MOUD in the postpartum period.','Later diagnosis of OUD in pregnancy among non-White/Hispanic women partially explains the disparities in MOUD receipt in this population. Universal substance use screening earlier in pregnancy, combined with connecting patients to evidence-based and culturally competent care, is one approach that could close the observed racial-ethnic disparity in MOUD receipt."
"Higher COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in rural than in urban areas are well documented (1). These disparities persisted during the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant surges during late 2021 and early 2022 (1,2). Rural populations tend to be older (aged ≥65 years) and uninsured and are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and live farther from facilities that provide tertiary medical care, placing them at higher risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes (2). To better understand COVID-19 vaccination disparities between urban and rural populations, CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among persons aged ≥5 years who received their first dose of either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine or a single dose of the Ad.26.COV2.S (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) COVID-19 vaccine during December 14, 2020-January 31, 2022, in 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). COVID-19 vaccination coverage with ≥1 doses in rural areas (58.5%) was lower than that in urban counties (75.4%) overall, with similar patterns across age groups and sex. Coverage with ≥1 doses varied among states: 46 states had higher coverage in urban than in rural counties, one had higher coverage in rural than in urban counties. Three states and DC had no rural counties; thus, urban-rural differences could not be assessed. COVID-19 vaccine primary series completion was higher in urban than in rural counties. However, receipt of booster or additional doses among primary series recipients was similarly low between urban and rural counties. Compared with estimates from a previous study of vaccine coverage among adults aged ≥18 years during December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021, these urban-rural disparities among those now eligible for vaccination (aged ≥5 years) have increased more than twofold through January 2022, despite increased availability and access to COVID-19 vaccines. Addressing barriers to vaccination in rural areas is critical to achieving vaccine equity, reducing disparities, and decreasing COVID-19-related illness and death in the United States (2)."
"Birthing people of color are more likely to deliver low birthweight and preterm infants, populations at significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Birthing people of color are also at higher risk for mental health conditions and emergency mental healthcare utilization postpartum. Although this group has been identified as high risk in these contexts, it is not known whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in mental healthcare utilization among birthing people who have delivered preterm.','We sought to determine if racial and ethnic disparities exist in postpartum mental healthcare-associated emergency department visits or hospitalizations for birthing people with preterm infants in a large and diverse population.','This population-based historic cohort study used a sample of Californian live-born infants born between 2011 and 2017 with linked birth certificates and emergency department visit and hospital admission records from the California Statewide Health Planning and Development database. The sample was restricted to preterm infants (<37 weeks' gestation). Self-reported race and ethnicity groups included Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic White, and non-Hispanic others. Mental health diagnoses were identified from the International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth revision codes recorded in emergency department and hospital discharge records. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between mental health-related emergency department visits and rehospitalizations by race or ethnicity compared with non-Hispanic White birthing people and controlling for the following characteristics and health condition covariates: age, parity, previous preterm birth, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, diabetes, previous mental health diagnosis, and prenatal care.','Of 204,539 birthing people who delivered preterm infants in California, 1982 visited the emergency department and 836 were hospitalized in the first year after preterm birth for a mental health-related illness. Black birthing people were more likely to have a mental health-related emergency department visit and hospitalization (risk ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.0 and risk ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.3, respectively) within the first postpartum year than White birthing people. Hispanic and Asian birthing people were less likely to have mental health-related emergency department visits (adjusted risk ratio, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-0.8 and adjusted risk ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.3, respectively) and hospitalizations (adjusted risk ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.7 and adjusted risk ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.3, respectively). When controlling for birthing people with a previous mental health diagnosis and those without, the disparities remained the same.','Racial and ethnic disparities exist in emergency mental healthcare escalation among birthing people who have delivered preterm infants. Our findings highlight a need for further investigation into disparate mental health conditions, exacerbations, access to care, and targeted hospital and legislative policies to prevent emergency mental healthcare escalation and reduce disparities."
"Long-standing health disparities experienced by American Indians (AIs) are associated with increased all-cause mortality rates and shortened life expectancies when compared to other races and ethnicities. Nationally, these disparities have persisted with the COVID-19 pandemic as AIs are more likely than all other races to be infected, hospitalized, or die from SARS-CoV-2. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, the only federally recognized American Indian tribe in the state, has been one of the hardest hit in the nation.','Using de-identified data from the University of Mississippi Medical Center's COVID-19 Research Registry, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess COVID-19 inpatient mortality outcomes among adults (≥ age 18) admitted at the state's safety net hospital in 2020.','Exactly 41% (n = 25) of American Indian adults admitted with a deemed diagnosis of COVID-19 died while in hospital, in comparison to 19% (n = 153) of blacks and 23% (n = 65) of whites. Racial disparities persisted even when controlling for those risk factors the CDC reported put adults at greatest risk of severe outcomes from the disease. The adjusted probability of inpatient mortality among American Indians was 46% (p < 0.00) in comparison to 19% among blacks and 20% among whites.','Although comorbidities were commonly observed among COVID-19 + American Indian inpatients, only one was associated with inpatient mortality. This challenges commonly cited theories attributing disparate COVID-19 mortality experiences among indigenous populations to disparate comorbidity experiences. Expanded studies are needed to further investigate these associations."
"The current study was aimed at quantifying the disparity in geographic access to cancer clinical trials in India.','We collated data of cancer clinical trials from the Clinical Trial Registry of India and data on state-wise cancer incidence from the Global Burden of Disease Study. The total sample size for each clinical trial was divided by the trial duration to get the sample size per year. This was then divided by the number of states in which accrual was planned to get the sample size per year per state (SSY).For interventional trials investigating a therapy, the SSY was divided by the number of incident cancers in the state to get the SSY per 1,000 incident cancer cases. The SSY data was then mapped to visualise the geographical disparity.','We identified 181 ongoing studies, of which 132 were interventional studies. There was a substantial inter-state disparity-with a median SSY of 1.55 per 1,000 incident cancer cases (range 0.00-296.81 per 1,000 incident cases) for therapeutic interventional studies. Disparities were starker when cancer site-wise SSY was considered. Even in the state with the highest SSY, only 29.7% of the newly diagnosed cancer cases have an available slot in a therapeutic cancer clinical trial. Disparities in access were also apparent between academic (range: 0.21-226.60) and industry-sponsored trials (range: 0.17-70.21).','There are significant geographic disparities in access to cancer clinical trials in India. Future investigations should evaluate the reasons and mitigation approaches for such disparities."
"There is an increasing focus on racial and social disparities in health care. There have been several studies that have documented disparities in outcome between racial groups in the adult literature. Not much is known about disparities in outcomes after surgical procedures in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of race on complications (outcomes) and costs after laparoscopic appendectomy.','This study is a single-center retrospective chart review of 248 pediatric patients who underwent appendectomies for uncomplicated acute appendicitis from 2015 to 2017. Patients were divided into minority (Africa American or Hispanic) and non-minority groups, and length of stay, preoperative and postoperative factors, and total costs were compared.','Of 185 eligible patients, 45.9% (n = 85) were of Hispanic or African American ethnicity and 54.1% (n = 100) were Caucasian. About 11.8% of minority patients had comorbidities and 12% of majority patients had comorbidities (p = 1). Readmission rate for minority group patients was 3.5% (n = 3) and 2% (n = 2) for majority patients (p = 0.7). The average cost of hospital stay for minority patients was $30,900 and for majority patients was $31,111 (p = 0.59).','Standardization of care protocols has reduced social/racial disparities in surgical outcomes. In the most common pediatric surgery emergency procedure, laparoscopic appendectomy, there were no differences in outcomes or costs between minority (Hispanic/Africa American) and Caucasian ethnic groups.','Level III.','Clinical Study."
"Left unchecked, pre-diabetes progresses to diabetes and its complications that are important health burdens in the United States. There is evidence of geographic disparities in the condition with some areas having a significantly high risks of the condition and its risk factors. Identifying these disparities, their determinants, and changes in burden are useful for guiding control programs and stopping the progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate geographic disparities of pre-diabetes prevalence in Florida, identify predictors of the observed spatial patterns, as well as changes in disease burden between 2013 and 2016.','The 2013 and 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were obtained from the Florida Department of Health. Counties with significant changes in the prevalence of the condition between 2013 and 2016 were identified using tests for equality of proportions adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Simes method. Flexible scan statistics were used to identify significant high prevalence geographic clusters. Multivariable regression models were used to identify determinants of county-level pre-diabetes prevalence.','The state-wide age-adjusted prevalence of pre-diabetes increased significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) from 8.0% in 2013 to 10.5% in 2016 with 72% (48/67) of the counties reporting statistically significant increases. Significant local geographic hotspots were identified. High prevalence of pre-diabetes tended to occur in counties with high proportions of non-Hispanic black population, low median household income, and low proportion of the population without health insurance coverage.','Geographic disparities of pre-diabetes continues to exist in Florida with most counties reporting significant increases in prevalence between 2013 and 2016. These findings are critical for guiding health planning, resource allocation and intervention programs."
"Early reports from the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic reveal ethnic disparities in coronavirus incidence, severity, and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between ethnicity and outcomes of coronavirus positivity and hospitalization.','An observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from a large community healthcare system in Washington State across the first phase of the pandemic (March 5 - June 7, 2020).','A total of 18,667 patients (65.9% of all tested) with EHR-documented ethnicity were included. Overall, 6.4% of patients tested positive for coronavirus. Among Latinx patients, 18.6% of those tested were positive, compared to only 4.0% of tested White patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds of positivity for Latinxs (aOR = 4.96, 95% CI 4.19-5.87), Asians (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.74-3.08), Blacks (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.31), and members of other ethnic minority groups (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.80-2.95), compared to Whites in models adjusting for relevant confounders. Latinxs had a higher percentage of self-pay insurance (22.2%) compared to other ethnic groups (7.9-15.8%) and, among those who tested positive, were the only ethnic subpopulation with significantly higher odds than Whites to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (aOR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.45-3.33). We observed a positive correlation between infection and the percentage of Latinxs (<i>r</i> = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.74), Blacks (<i>r</i> = 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.66), or Asians (<i>r</i> = 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) in a given zip-code. This correlationwas negative for Whites (<i>r</i> = -0.63, 95% CI -0.75, -0.45).','We present empirical evidence of higher rates of coronavirus positivity among People of Color compared to White people in Washington State. Social determinants of health, such as occupation, housing, healthcare access, and community structure, may contribute to health disparities in the coronavirus pandemic. Targeted capture of these variables in electronic health records is warranted to inform health equity analyses."
"The objective of the study is the identification of racial differences in characteristics and comorbidities in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and the impact on outcomes.','The study design is a retrospective observational study.','Data for all patients admitted to seven community hospitals in Michigan, United States, with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 10 to April 15, 2020 were analyzed. The primary outcomes of racial disparity in inpatient mortality and intubation were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models.','The study included 336 Black and 408 White patients. Black patients were younger (62.9 ± 15.0 years vs 71.8 ± 16.4, P < .001), had a higher mean body mass index (32.4 ± 8.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs 28.8 ± 7.5, P < .001), had higher prevalence of diabetes (136/336 vs 130/408, P = .02), and presented later (6.6 ± 5.3 days after symptom onset vs. 5.4 ± 5.4, P = .006) compared with White patients. Younger Black patients had a higher prevalence of obesity (age <65 years, 69.9%) than older Black patients (age >65 years, 39.2%) and younger White patients (age < 65, 55.1%). Intubation did not reach statistical significance for racial difference (Black patients 61/335 vs. 54/406, P = .08). Mortality was not higher in Black patients (65/335 vs. 142/406 in White patients, odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.37 to 0.99, 2-sided P = .05) in multivariate analysis, accounting for other risk factors associated with mortality.','Higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes in young Black populations may be the critical factor driving disproportionate COVID-19 hospitalizations in Black populations. Hospitalized Black patients do not have worse outcomes compared with White patients."
"Preeclampsia is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, affecting up to 8% of pregnancies globally. Although the precise etiology is still under study, the literature suggests that vascular changes reduce placental perfusion and affect the remodeling of spiral arteries to create the hallmark feature of preeclampsia: elevated blood pressure. Screening for preeclampsia is currently recommended for all pregnant women, particularly if risk factors exist. A noted risk factor codified in guidelines is ""African-American race.""','We summarize the racial disparities in preeclampsia incidence, morbidity, and mortality. We consider the limitations of using race to understand disparities by also examining multiethnic, immigration, and international studies. We then critically evaluate laboratory analytes associated with racial disparities of preeclampsia and explore other mechanisms of action, such as socioeconomic status, stress, and access to care.','Black and African-American women are consistently at higher risk of preeclampsia incidence, morbidity, and mortality than their white counterparts. Asian women are consistently at lower risk of preeclampsia, whereas the association for Hispanic women remains unclear. When these broad racial categories are subdivided by geographic or cultural origin, preeclampsia disparities within racial groups are identified. The limited literature suggests that sub-Saharan African immigrants tend to have a higher risk of preeclampsia than US-born white populations but a lower risk than US-born Black women. Existing studies seeking to identify racial differences in analytes have limited research designs and tend to operationalize race as a proxy for biologically inherent (i.e., genetic) differences between races despite a plethora of other possible explanatory mechanisms."
"Research has demonstrated that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a safe and effective way to decrease HPV-related cervical cancers; however, the vaccination rate in the USA is suboptimal. The current study examined racial and ethnic disparities in HPV vaccination among a nationally representative sample, including Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (NHPI). This study also investigated the associations between nativity and vaccination, and sex differences between race/ethnicity and vaccination and nativity and vaccination. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of adults aged 18-26 years drawn from the 2014 NHPI National Health Interview Survey (n = 2590) and the general 2014 National Health Interview Survey (n = 36,697). Log-binomial models were fitted to examine differences in vaccination. There was a statistically significant racial/ethnic difference in HPV vaccination (p = 0.003). More women than men were vaccinated (41.8% vs. 10.1%) (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in HPV vaccination based on nativity: 27.4% of adults aged 18 to 26 years who were born in the USA and 27.7% born in a US territory received the HPV vaccine compared with 14.3% among those not born in the USA or a US territory (p < 0.001). The association of HPV vaccination with nativity and race/ethnicity differed by sex and showed several nuanced differences. Overall, the prevalence of HPV vaccination was low. The study's findings demonstrate the need for public health strategies to increase vaccination rates among all populations, with the critical need to identify strategies that are effective for men, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrant women born outside the USA."
"Investigate whether or not race is associated with differences in hospitalization and survival to discharge among patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) at the height of the pandemic in New York City (NYC).','Single-center retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at our university-affiliated NYC hospital from 3/10/20 through 4/13/20 with follow-up to 5/1/20. Our primary endpoint was hospitalization rate among patients with confirmed COVID-19 compared with the regional population based on race. Our secondary endpoint survival to discharge among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. NYC Department of Health data were used to calculate hospitalization odds ratios. Chi-square and t tests were used to compare categorial and continuous variables, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression and predictive analysis were used to investigate our endpoints further.','Our cohort of 734 patients included 355 women (48.4%), 372 Blacks (50.7%), 214 Whites (29.2%), and 92 Hispanics (12.5%) in our analysis. Blacks were nearly twice as likely as Whites to require hospitalization for COVID-19 (OR 1.89, 95% CI, 1.59-2.24, p < 0.001). Hispanics were also more likely to suffer in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 compared with Whites (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.21-2.80; p = 0.005). There was a non-significant increased hazard of in-hospital mortality among Blacks when compared with Whites (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.95-1.78; p = 0.09).','Blacks were more likely than Whites to require hospitalization for COVID-19 while Hispanics were more likely to experience in-hospital mortality. Further investigation into the socioeconomic factors underlying racial disparities in COVID-19 survival and severity requiring hospitalization is needed on a national scale."
"Minimal research has been conducted to examine the impact and reach of state offices of minority health (SOMH) and their role in reducing racial and ethnic health disparities within their states. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to describe the shared experiences of SOMH officers to provide context for why these individuals believe that state organizational efforts have not yielded much success in reducing racial and ethnic health disparity gaps.','Using a telephone interview guide, the investigators conducted telephone interviews with SOMH officers. Data were analyzed thematically based on emergent patterns in participant responses. A total of 47 of 50 state officers (94%) completed the interview.','Though many officers were encouraged by increased awareness regarding health disparities, nearly every officer listed inadequate resources as the most impactful barrier impeding the success of their offices' missions.','SOMH continue to be severely underfunded and are concerned about their potential for success, leaving them with minimal ability to engage in activities beyond educational awareness campaigns. For SOMH officers to be successful in eliminating disparities, legislators must provide them with adequate funding so they can engage in wider-reaching interventions targeting the social determinants of health."
"Cancer care disparities among rural populations are increasingly documented, and may be worsening, likely due to the impact of rurality on access to state-of-the-art cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services, as well as higher rates of risk factors such as smoking and obesity. In 2018, the American Society of Clinical Oncology undertook an initiative to understand and address factors contributing to rural cancer care disparities. A key pillar of this initiative was to identify knowledge gaps and promote the research needed to understand the magnitude of difference in outcomes in rural versus non-rural settings, the drivers of those differences, and interventions to address them. The purpose of this review is to describe continued knowledge gaps and areas of priority research to address them. We conducted a comprehensive literature review by searching the PubMed (Medline), Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published in English between 1971 and 2021 and restricted to primary reports from populations in the US, and abstracted data to synthesize current evidence and identify continued gaps in knowledge. Our review identified continuing gaps in the literature regarding the underlying causes of rural-urban disparities in cancer outcomes. Rapid advances in cancer care will worsen existing disparities in outcomes for rural patients without directed effort to understand and address barriers to high quality care in these areas. Research should be prioritized to address ongoing knowledge gaps about the drivers of rurality-based disparities, and preventative and corrective interventions."
"This paper reviews differences in the experience of the menopause transition and midlife health outcomes between Black and White women who participated in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a 25-year, longitudinal, multi-racial/ethnic cohort study. We identify health disparities, i.e., instances in which Black women's outcomes are less favorable than those of White women, and consider whether structural racism may underlie these disparities. Although SWAN did not explicitly assess structural racism, Black women in SWAN grew up during the Jim Crow era in the United States, during which time racism was legally sanctioned. We consider how we might gain insight into structural racism by examining proxy exposures such as socioeconomic characteristics, reports of everyday discrimination, and a range of life stressors, which likely reflect the longstanding, pervasive and persistent inequities that have roots in systemic racism in the US. Thus, this paper reviews the presence, magnitude, and longitudinal patterns of racial disparities observed in SWAN in six areas of women's health - menopause symptoms, sleep, mental health, health related quality of life, cardio-metabolic health, and physical function -and elucidates the contextual factors that are likely influencing these disparities. We review the strengths and weaknesses of SWAN's design and approach to analysis of racial disparities and use this as a springboard to offer recommendations for future cohort studies."
"Ensuring equitable care remains a critical issue for healthcare systems. Nationwide evidence highlights the persistence of healthcare disparities and the need for research-informed approaches for reducing them at the local level.','To characterize key contributors in racial/ethnic disparities in emergency department (ED) throughput times.','We conducted a sequential mixed methods analysis to understand variations in ED care throughput times for patients eventually admitted to an emergency department at a single academic medical center from November 2017 to May 2018 (n=3152). We detailed patient progression from ED arrival to decision to admit and compared racial/ethnic differences in time intervals from electronic medical record time-stamp data. We then estimated the relationships between race/ethnicity and ED throughput times, adjusting for several patient-level variables and ED-level covariates. These quantitative analyses informed our qualitative study design, which included observations and semi-structured interviews with patients and physicians.','Non-Hispanic Black as compared to non-Hispanic White patients waited significantly longer during the time interval from arrival to the physician's decision to admit, even after adjustment for several ED-level and patient demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic variables (Beta (average minutes) (SE): 16.35 (5.8); p value=.005). Qualitative findings suggest that the manner in which providers communicate, advocate, and prioritize patients may contribute to such disparities. When the race/ethnicity of provider and patient differed, providers were more likely to interrupt patients, ignore their requests, and make less eye contact. Conversely, if the race/ethnicity of provider and patient were similar, providers exhibited a greater level of advocacy, such as tracking down patient labs or consultants. Physicians with no significant ED throughput disparities articulated objective criteria such as triage scores for prioritizing patients.','Our findings suggest the importance of (1) understanding how our communication style and care may differ by race/ethnicity; and (2) taking advantage of structured processes designed to equalize care."
"This study aims to better understand differing pain experiences across U.S. racial/ethnic subgroups by estimating racial-ethnic disparities in both pain intensity and domain-specific pain-related interference. To address this issue, we use a nationally representative sample of non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic adults ages 50+ who report recently experiencing pain.','Using data from the 2010 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; N = 684), we conducted a series of multivariate analyses to assess possible racial/ethnic disparities in pain intensity and 7 domains of pain interference, controlling for relevant sociodemographic variables and other health problems.','Black and Hispanic participants reported higher pain intensity than White participants after controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) and other health conditions. Both Black and Hispanic individuals reported more domain-specific pain interference in bivariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, Black (vs White) participants reported significantly higher levels of pain interference with family-home responsibilities, occupation, sexual behavior, and daily self-care. We did not find significant Hispanic-White differences in the 7 pain interference domains, nor did we find Black-White differences in 3 domains (recreation, social activities, and essential activities).','Our findings highlight the need for using multidimensional measures of pain when assessing for possible pain disparities with respect to race/ethnicity. Future studies on pain interventions should consider contextualizing the pain experience across different racial subgroups to help pain patients with diverse needs, with the ultimate goal of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain."
"Adolescence is a sensitive period for the development of disordered eating and weight-related behaviors, and sexual minorities may be particularly at risk due to heightened minority stress and challenges related to sexual identity development. This review synthesized findings from 32 articles that examined sexual orientation disparities (each with a heterosexual referent group) in four disordered eating behaviors (binging, purging, restrictive dieting, diet pill use) and four weight-related behaviors (eating behaviors, physical activity, body image, and Body Mass Index [BMI]). Potential variations by outcome, sex, race/ethnicity, and developmental stage were systematically reviewed. Evidence supporting sexual orientation disparities in disordered eating and weight-related behaviors was more consistent among males than females. Among females, sexual orientation disparities in disordered eating behaviors appeared to be more pronounced during adolescence than in young adulthood. Sexual minority females generally reported more positive body image than heterosexual females but experienced disparities in BMI. Sexual orientation differences in eating behaviors and physical activity were especially understudied. Incorporating objectification and minority stress theory, a developmental model was devised where body image was conceptualized as a key mechanism leading to disordered eating behaviors. To advance understanding of sexual orientation disparities and tailor intervention efforts, research in this field should utilize longitudinal study designs to examine developmental variations and incorporate multi-dimensional measurements of sexual orientation and body image."
"Surgeon caseload has been shown to affect both health and economic outcomes in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Although previous studies have investigated disparities in access to care, little is known about disparities between low- and high-volume surgeons and facilities.','To identify where disparities may exist regarding access to high-volume surgeons and facilities.','Cross-sectional study.','Univariate analysis was performed to analyze differences in the caseload between low- and high-volume surgeons and facilities. Cutoff values were set at 50 cases per year for high-volume surgeons and 125 cases annually for high-volume facilities. Multiple linear regression was then used to develop a cost model incorporating all variables significant under univariate analysis. We collected 18,616 cases with Current Procedural Terminology code 29827 (""arthroscopic rotator cuff repair"") from the 2014 Florida State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases.','A greater proportion of the caseload for low-volume surgeons and facilities was composed of patients who were of lower socioeconomic status, had government-subsidized insurance, or lived in areas with low-income ZIP codes. Low-volume surgeons and facilities also had higher total charges, higher postoperative admission rates, and lower distal clavicle excision rates (<i>P</i> < .001). In our cost model, a low facility volume significantly increased costs. Subacromial decompression, postoperative admission, distal clavicle excision, male sex, and government-subsidized insurance were all significant factors for increased costs in multivariate cost analysis.','There are disparities in access to high-volume surgeons and facilities for patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in Florida. Patients with a lower socioeconomic status, government-subsidized insurance, and low income all faced decreased access to these high-volume groups. High-volume surgeons and facilities were associated with lower total charges, higher rates of distal clavicle excision, and lower readmission rates. Low-volume facilities added a significant amount of cost, even when controlling for all other significant variables. It is important for providers to be aware of these disparities and work to address them in their own practices."
"Studies disagree about whether racial and ethnic groups have lower or higher human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake, an important issue given large disparities in some HPV cancers. We sought to characterize and explain racial and ethnic differences in HPV vaccination. We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science to identify US studies through mid-2017 reporting associations of race and ethnicity with HPV vaccination. We identified 118 studies (n = 3,095,486) published in English that reported HPV vaccine initiation or follow-through in the US from which we could calculate effect sizes. We used random effects meta-analysis to synthesize effect sizes for comparisons of Whites or non-Hispanics to Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or all minority groups combined. Studies showed no racial or ethnic differences in HPV vaccine initiation overall. However, when restricting to studies using provider-verified vaccination data, minorities were 6.1% [3.3%-8.8%] more likely than Whites to initiate HPV vaccination. Advantages were larger for Hispanics, males, and younger samples (age < 18). In contrast, minorities were 8.6% [5.6%, 11.7%], less likely than Whites to follow-through with the full HPV vaccine series, a disparity present across all participant and study characteristics. More recent studies found larger advantages for racial and ethnic minorities in HPV vaccine initiation and smaller disparities in follow-through. In summary, high-quality studies found racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to initiate but less likely to follow-through with HPV vaccination, a clear finding that self-report studies obscure. Higher HPV vaccine initiation among minorities suggests potential reductions in HPV cancer disparities."
"Sexual minority mental health disparities are well documented. However, distinct sexual minority subgroups are often collapsed into a single ""lesbian, gay, or bisexual"" (LGB) analytic group. While limited research has shown sexual minority subgroup differences in mental health, little is known about the factors underlying these differences. This study examines whether sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial characteristics are associated with sexual orientation subgroup differences in mental health.','Using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, Wave III, differences in various mental health measures, and sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial characteristics were assessed across three sexual minority subgroups [lesbians/gay men, bisexuals, and heterosexuals reporting same-sex attractions or behaviors (""heterosexual-identified sexual minorities, HSM"")] and heterosexuals reporting only opposite-sex attractions and behaviors (""heterosexuals""). Sequential linear regressions evaluated the degrees to which different factors attenuated mental health (SF-12) disparities between heterosexuals and sexual minority subgroups. Analyses were sex-stratified.','Several sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial characteristic differences existed between sexual orientation groups. Further, all sexual minority subgroups had lower SF-12 scores than heterosexuals, except lesbian women. Sociodemographic factors attenuated the disparity for bisexual men. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, plus psychosocial factors attenuated the disparity for HSM men. However, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors partially, but did not fully, attenuate the disparity for gay men, bisexual women, or HSM women.','Different factors are associated with mental health disparities for sexual minority subgroups. To maximize health intervention efforts, additional research is needed to uncover the specific mechanisms contributing to health disparities across diverse sexual minority populations."
"Objectives Pennsylvania's maternal mortality, infant mortality, and preterm birth rates rank 24th, 35th, and 25th in the country, and are higher among racial and ethnic minorities. Provision of prenatal and postpartum care represents one way to improve these outcomes. We assessed the extent of disparities in the provision and timeliness of prenatal and postpartum care for women enrolled in Pennsylvania Medicaid. Methods We performed a cross-sectional evaluation of representative samples of women who delivered live births from November 2011 to 2015. Our outcomes were three binary effectiveness-of-care measures: prenatal care timeliness, frequency of prenatal care, and postpartum care timeliness. Pennsylvania's Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) were required to submit these outcomes to the state after reviewing administrative and medical records through a standardized, validated sampling process. We assessed for differences in outcomes by race, ethnicity, region, year, and MCO using logistic regression. Results We analyzed data for 12,228 women who were 49% White, 31% Black/African American, 4% Asian, and 15% Hispanic/Latina. Compared to Black/African American women, white and Asian women had higher odds of prenatal and postpartum care. Hispanic/Latina women had higher frequency of prenatal care than non-Hispanic women. Pennsylvania's Southeast had lower prenatal care and Northwest had lower postpartum care than other regions. Prenatal care significantly decreased in 2014 and increased in 2015. We observed differences between MCOs, and as MCO performance diminished, racial disparities within each plan widened. We explored hypotheses for observed disparities in secondary analyses. Conclusions for Practice Our data demonstrate that interventions should address disparities by race, region, and MCO in equity-promoting measures."
"While the rate of unintended pregnancy has declined in the United States in recent years, unintended pregnancy among teens in the United States is the highest among industrialized nations, and disproportionately affects minority teens.','Our objective of this secondary analysis was to estimate the risk of unintended pregnancy for both Black and White teens age 15-19 years when barriers to access, cost, and knowledge are removed. Our hypothesis was that the Black-White disparities would be reduced when access, education, and cost barriers are removed.','We performed an analysis of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project database. CHOICE is a longitudinal cohort study of 9256 sexually active girls and women ages 14-45 years in the St Louis, MO, region from 2007 through 2013. Two measures of disparities were used to analyze teenage pregnancy rates and pregnancy risk from 2008 through 2013 among teens ages 15-19 years. These rates were then compared to the rates of pregnancy among all sexually active teens in the United States during the years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. We estimated an absolute measure (rate difference) and a relative measure (rate ratio) to examine Black-White disparities in the rates of unintended pregnancy.','While national rates of unintended pregnancy are decreasing, racial disparities in these rates persist. The Black-White rate difference dropped from 158.5 per 1000 in 2008 to 120.1 per 1000 in 2011; however, the relative ratio disparity decreased only from 2.6-2.5, suggesting that Black sexually active teens in the United States have 2.5 times the rate of unintended pregnancy as White teenagers. In the CHOICE Project, there was a decreasing trend in racial disparities in unintended pregnancy rates among sexually active teens (age 15-19 years): 2008 through 2009 (rate difference, 18.2; rate ratio, 3.7), 2010 through 2011 (rate difference, 4.3; rate ratio, 1.2), and 2012 through 2013 (rate difference, -1.5; rate ratio, 1.0).','When barriers to cost, access, and knowledge were removed, such as in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, Black-White disparities in unintended pregnancy rates among sexually active teens were reduced on both absolute and relative scales. The rate of unintended pregnancy was almost equal between Black and White teens compared to large Black-White disparities on the national level."
"Prostate cancer mortality rates have decreased over recent decades, but racial disparities in prostate cancer survival still present as a serious challenge. These disparities may be impacted by age; in fact, African-American men younger than age 65 have prostate cancer mortality rates nearly three times greater than that of White men. Therefore, a systematic literature review was conducted in Medline and EMBASE databases focusing on articles comparing survival and mortality rates for prostate cancer patients across age and race.','Articles included were based on the following criteria: (1) included African-American and White prostate cancer patients residing in the US; (2) measured racial disparities across distinct age categories with at least one category below and one above age 65; and (3) addressed racial disparities in terms of overall survival or mortality.','Twenty eight articles compared survival and mortality disparities between African-American and White prostate cancer patients across different age categories. Of the 28 articles, 19 articles (68%) showed disparities decreased with age, 8 articles (29%) showed disparities constant with age, and 1 article (3%) showed disparities increased with age.','More often the survival and mortality gap between African-American and White prostate cancer patients decreases with age. Additional studies are needed to elucidate other factors that may influence racial disparities in prostate cancer patients. These results provide insight into the racial disparities in prostate cancer and suggest more resources should be directed towards decreasing the disparity gap in younger prostate cancer patients."
"Continued racial/ethnic health disparities were recently described as ""the most serious and shameful health care issue of our time."" Although the 2014 US Affordable Care Act-mandated national insurance coverage expansion has led to significant improvements in health care coverage and access, its effects on life expectancy are not yet known. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest US integrated health care system, has a sustained commitment to health equity that addresses all 3 stages of health disparities research: detection, understanding determinants, and reduction or elimination. Despite this, racial disparities still exist in the VHA across a wide range of clinical areas and service types.','To inform the health equity research agenda, we synthesized evidence on racial/ethnic mortality disparities in the VHA.','Our research librarian searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials from October 2006 through February 2017 using terms for racial groups and disparities.','We included studies if they compared mortality between any racial/ethnic minority and nonminority veteran groups or between different minority groups in the VHA (PROSPERO# CRD42015015974). We made study selection decisions on the basis of prespecified eligibility criteria. They were first made by 1 reviewer and checked by a second and disagreements were resolved by consensus (sequential review).','Two reviewers sequentially abstracted data on prespecified population, outcome, setting, and study design characteristics. Two reviewers sequentially graded the strength of evidence using prespecified criteria on the basis of 5 key domains: study limitations (study design and internal validity), consistency, directness, precision of the evidence, and reporting biases. We synthesized the evidence qualitatively by grouping studies first by racial/ethnic minority group and then by clinical area. For areas with multiple studies in the same population and outcome, we pooled their reported hazard ratios (HRs) using random effects models (StatsDirect version 2.8.0; StatsDirect Ltd., Altrincham, England). We created an evidence map using a bubble plot format to represent the evidence base in 5 dimensions: odds ratio or HR of mortality for racial/ethnic minority group versus Whites, clinical area, strength of evidence, statistical significance, and racial group.','From 2840 citations, we included 25 studies. Studies were large (n ≥ 10 000) and involved nationally representative cohorts, and the majority were of fair quality. Most studies compared mortality between Black and White veterans and found similar or lower mortality for Black veterans. However, we found modest mortality disparities (HR or OR = 1.07, 1.52) for Black veterans with stage 4 chronic kidney disease, colon cancer, diabetes, HIV, rectal cancer, or stroke; for American Indian and Alaska Native veterans undergoing noncardiac major surgery; and for Hispanic veterans with HIV or traumatic brain injury (most low strength).','Although the VHA's equal access health care system has reduced many racial/ethnic mortality disparities present in the private sector, our review identified mortality disparities that have persisted mainly for Black veterans in several clinical areas. However, because most mortality disparities were supported by single studies with imprecise findings, we could not draw strong conclusions about this evidence. More disparities research is needed for American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian, and Hispanic veterans overall and for more of the largest life expectancy gaps. Public Health Implications. Because of the relatively high prevalence of diabetes in Black veterans, further research to better understand and reduce this mortality disparity may be prioritized as having the greatest potential impact. However, other mortality disparities affect thousands of veterans and cannot be ignored."
"Introduction: As an initiative to improve the quality of health care, the trend in biomedical research focused on health disparities and sex has increased.
Objective: To carry out a characterization of the scientific evidence on health disparity defined as the gap between the distribution of health and the possible gender bias for access to medical services.
Materials and methods: We conducted a simultaneous search of two fundamental descriptors in the scientific literature in the Medline PubMed database: healthcare
disparities and sexism. Subsequently, a main semantic network was built and some structural subunits (communities) were identified for the analysis of information organization patterns. We used open-source software: Cytoscape to analyze and visualize the semantic network, and MapEquation for community detection, as well as an ad hoc code available in a public access repository.
Results: The core network corpus showed that the terms on heart disease were the most common among the descriptors of medical conditions. Patterns of information related to public policies, health services, social determinants, and risk factors were identified from the structural subunits, but with a certain tendency to remain indirectly connected to the nodes of medical conditions.
Conclusions: Scientific evidence indicates that gender disparity does matter for the care quality in many diseases, especially those related to the circulatory system. However, there is still a gap between the medical and social factors that give rise to possible disparities by sex."
"There are various racial, socioeconomic, and tumor-specific factors that can impact rectal cancer outcomes. The current systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the effect socioeconomic and racial variables on overall survival of rectal cancer patients after surgical resection.','A literature search was performed via electronic databases according to Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. All studies were evaluated by three authors and validated for data extraction. Predictive variables and survival profiles (1-, 5-, and 10-y survival and overall survival) reported by the studies were recorded for the systematic review. Hazard ratios, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were extracted for meta-analysis. Forest plots were used to interpret the results. The primary outcome was the effect size of the predictive variables on overall survival after surgical resection.','Of the 265 articles collected, 22 met inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies were used for the systematic review, and 17 studies were considered for meta-analysis. Overall, 662,053 subjects with rectal cancer were studied (439,766 with race reported), of which 344,193 (78.3%) were White and 60,283 (13.7%) were Black. The median survival was 56.8% for White patients and 47.9% for Black patients. Meta-analysis revealed that race, socioeconomic variables (education level, income level, and insurance status), and facility characteristics (type and volume) were significantly associated with overall survival in rectal cancer.','Racial and socioeconomic disparities are present in outcomes for rectal cancer patients undergoing surgical resection. It is important to consider these disparities in the management of patients with rectal cancer to minimize any consequent disparities in surgical outcomes."
"Black patients with hypertension often have the lowest rates of blood pressure (BP) control in clinical settings. It is unknown to what extent variation in health care processes explains this disparity.','To assess whether and to what extent treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits are associated with racial and ethnic disparities in BP control.','In this cohort study, nested logistic regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of BP control (defined as a systolic BP [SBP] level <140 mm Hg) by race and ethnicity, and a structural equation model was used to assess the association of treatment intensification, scheduled follow-up interval, and missed visits with racial and ethnic disparities in BP control. The study included 16 114 adults aged 20 years or older with hypertension and elevated BP (defined as an SBP level ≥140 mm Hg) during at least 1 clinic visit between January 1, 2015, and November 15, 2017. A total of 11 safety-net clinics within the San Francisco Health Network participated in the study. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to October 2020.','Blood pressure control was assessed using the patient's most recent BP measurement as of November 15, 2017. Treatment intensification was calculated using the standard-based method, scored on a scale from -1.0 to 1.0, with -1.0 being the least amount of intensification and 1.0 being the most. Scheduled follow-up interval was defined as the mean number of days to the next scheduled visit after an elevated BP measurement. Missed visits measured the number of patients who did not show up for visits during the 4 weeks after an elevated BP measurement.','Among 16 114 adults with hypertension, the mean (SD) age was 58.6 (12.1) years, and 8098 patients (50.3%) were female. A total of 4658 patients (28.9%) were Asian, 3743 (23.2%) were Black, 3694 (22.9%) were Latinx, 2906 (18.0%) were White, and 1113 (6.9%) were of other races or ethnicities (including American Indian or Alaska Native [77 patients (0.4%)], Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander [217 patients (1.3%)], and unknown [819 patients (5.1%)]). Compared with patients from all racial and ethnic groups, Black patients had lower treatment intensification scores (mean [SD], -0.33 [0.26] vs -0.29 [0.25]; β = -0.03, P < .001) and missed more visits (mean [SD], 0.8 [1.5] visits vs 0.4 [1.1] visits; β = 0.35; P < .001). In contrast, Asian patients had higher treatment intensification scores (mean [SD], -0.26 [0.23]; β = 0.02; P < .001) and fewer missed visits (mean [SD], 0.2 [0.7] visits; β = -0.20; P < .001). Black patients were less likely (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75-0.89; P < .001) and Asian patients were more likely (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25; P < .001) to achieve BP control than patients from all racial or ethnic groups. Treatment intensification and missed visits accounted for 21% and 14%, respectively, of the total difference in BP control among Black patients and 26% and 13% of the difference among Asian patients.','This study's findings suggest that racial and ethnic inequities in treatment intensification may be associated with more than 20% of observed racial or ethnic disparities in BP control, and racial and ethnic differences in visit attendance may also play a role. Ensuring more equitable provision of treatment intensification could be a beneficial health care strategy to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in BP control."
"Clinician empathy is a vital component of high-quality healthcare. Healthcare disparities may reflect a societal lack of empathy for disadvantaged persons in general, and recent research suggests that socioeconomic disparities exist in patient satisfaction with clinicians. However, it is currently unclear if there are disparities in patient experience of empathy from clinicians. Our objective is to systematically analyse the scientific literature to test the hypothesis that racial and socioeconomic status (SES) disparities exist in patient-reported experience of clinician empathy.','In accordance with published methodological guidelines for conducting a systematic review, we will analyse studies reporting patient assessment of clinician empathy using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure, which to date is the most commonly used and well-validated methodology in clinical research for measuring clinician empathy from the patient's perspective. We will use a standardised data collection template and assess study quality (risk of bias) using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We will abstract data for the CARE measure stratified by race and SES, and we will contact the corresponding authors to obtain stratified data by race/SES if not reported in the original manuscript. Where appropriate, we will pool the data and perform quantitative meta-analysis to test if non-white (compared to white) patients and low SES (compared to high SES) patients report lower scores for clinician empathy.','No individual patient-level data will be collected and thus the proposed systematic review does not require ethical approval. This systematic review will test if racial and SES differences exist in patient experience of clinician empathy, and will inform future research to help promote healthcare equity.','CRD42019142809."
"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Obesity and metabolic syndrome are increasingly prevalent in the United States, particularly among African Americans and Latinos. Bariatric surgery has become one of the primary treatment modalities for obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, fewer Latinos and African Americans are undergoing bariatric surgery than whites. The aim of this article is to describe the disparities in seeking and accessing bariatric surgery, describe the outcomes following bariatric procedures in Latinos and African Americans, and offer recommendations and future research directions that may assist in addressing these disparities. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Original research and review articles published in English were reviewed. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Potential reasons why Latinos and African Americans have low rates of seeking bariatric surgery are described. Disparities in access to care and financial coverage, low rates of referral by primary care providers, and cultural attitudes toward obesity in conjunction with mistrust of the healthcare system are discussed as potential contributors to the low rate of bariatric surgery in Latinos and African Americans. Finally, disparities in bariatric surgery outcomes, comorbidities, and complications are reviewed. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Additional research studies in bariatric surgical disparities are needed. Recommendations and future directions that may help to reduce disparities in bariatric surgery are discussed."
"Addressing minority health and health disparities has been a missing piece of the puzzle in Big Data science. This article focuses on three priority opportunities that Big Data science may offer to the reduction of health and health care disparities. One opportunity is to incorporate standardized information on demographic and social determinants in electronic health records in order to target ways to improve quality of care for the most disadvantaged populations over time. A second opportunity is to enhance public health surveillance by linking geographical variables and social determinants of health for geographically defined populations to clinical data and health outcomes. Third and most importantly, Big Data science may lead to a better understanding of the etiology of health disparities and understanding of minority health in order to guide intervention development. However, the promise of Big Data needs to be considered in light of significant challenges that threaten to widen health disparities. Care must be taken to incorporate diverse populations to realize the potential benefits. Specific recommendations include investing in data collection on small sample populations, building a diverse workforce pipeline for data science, actively seeking to reduce digital divides, developing novel ways to assure digital data privacy for small populations, and promoting widespread data sharing to benefit under-resourced minority-serving institutions and minority researchers. With deliberate efforts, Big Data presents a dramatic opportunity for reducing health disparities but without active engagement, it risks further widening them."
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2). TNBC constitutes about 15-30 percent of all diagnosed invasive breast cancer cases in the United States. African-American (AA) women have high prevalence of TNBC with worse clinical outcomes than European-American (EA) women. The contributing factors underlying racial disparities have been divided into two major categories based on whether they are related to lifestyle (non-biologic) or unrelated to lifestyle (biologic). Our objective in the present review article was to understand the potential interactions by which these risk factors intersect to drive the initiation and development of the disparities resulting in the aggressive TNBC subtypes in AA women more likely than in EA women. To reach our goal, we conducted literature searches using MEDLINE/PubMed to identify relevant articles published from 2005 to 2019 addressing breast cancer disparities primarily among AA and EA women in the United States. We found that disparities in TNBC may be attributed to racial differences in biological factors, such as tumor heterogeneity, population genetics, somatic genomic mutations, and increased expression of genes in AA breast tumors which have direct link to breast cancer. In addition, a large number of non-biologic factors, including socioeconomic deprivation adversities associated with poverty, social stress, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of healthcare access and pattern of reproductive factors, can promote comorbid diseases such as obesity and diabetes which may adversely contribute to the aggression of TNBC biology in AA women. Further, the biological risk factors directly linked to TNBC in AA women may potentially interact with non-biologic factors to promote a higher prevalence of TNBC, more aggressive biology, and poor survival. The relative contributions of the biologic and non-biologic factors and their potential interactions is essential to our understanding of disproportionately high burden and poor survival rates of AA women with TNBC."
"Administrative data research on maternal racial disparities supports 2 broad clinical inferences. First, failure to rescue in terms of both death and severe maternal morbidity likely accounts for a significant proportion of maternal disparities. Second, risk for adverse outcomes by race is generally differential with risk for cardiovascular complications particularly high for non-Hispanic black women. These differentials suggest that underlying health conditions may represent an important contributor to overall disparities, and optimal longitudinal care utilization with nonobstetric specialists is required to mitigate risk."
"The exponential growth of health data from devices, health applications, and electronic health records coupled with the development of data analysis tools such as machine learning offer opportunities to leverage these data to mitigate health disparities. However, these tools have also been shown to exacerbate inequities faced by marginalized groups. Focusing on health disparities should be part of good machine learning practice and regulatory oversight of software as medical devices. Using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s proposed framework for regulating machine learning tools in medicine, I show that addressing health disparities during the premarket and postmarket stages of review can help anticipate and mitigate group harms."
"This paper describes the extent and variation in health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people within Alaska, Greenland and the northern regions of Canada, Russia and the Nordic countries. We accessed official health statistics and reviewed research studies. We selected a few indicators of health status, health determinants and health care to demonstrate the health disparities that exist. For a large number of health indicators Indigenous people fare worse than non-Indigenous people in the same region or nationally, with the exception of the Sami in the Nordic countries whose health profiles are similar to their non-Sami neighbours. That we were unable to produce a uniform set of indicators applicable to all regions is indicative of the large knowledge gaps that exist. The need for ongoing health monitoring for Indigenous people is most acute for the Sami and Russia, less so for Canada, and least for Alaska, where health data specific to Alaska Natives are generally available. It is difficult to produce an overarching explanatory model for health disparities that is applicable to all regions. We need to seek explanation in the broader political, cultural and societal contexts within which Indigenous people live in their respective regions."
"Prostate cancer (PCa) disproportionately affects African American men, but research evaluating the extent of racial and ethnic disparities across the PCa continuum in equal-access settings remains limited at the national level. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Hospital Administration health care system offers a setting of relatively equal access to care in which to assess racial and ethnic disparities in self-identified African American (or Black) veterans and White veterans.','To determine the extent of racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of PCa, clinical stage, and outcomes between African American patients and White patients who received a diagnosis or were treated at a VA hospital.','This retrospective cohort study included 7 889 984 veterans undergoing routine care in VA hospitals nationwide from 2005 through 2019 (incidence cohort). The age-adjusted incidence of localized and de novo metastatic PCa was estimated. Treatment response was evaluated, and PCa-specific outcomes were compared between African American veterans and White veterans. Residual disparity in PCa outcome, defined as the leftover racial and ethnic disparity in the outcomes despite equal response to treatment, was estimated.','Self-identified African American (or Black) and White race and ethnicity.','Time to distant metastasis following PCa diagnosis was the primary outcome. Descriptive analyses were used to compare baseline demographics and clinic characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate race and ethnicity association with pretreatment clinical variables. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate the risk of metastasis.','Data from 7 889 984 veterans from the incidence cohort were used to estimate incidence, whereas data from 92 269 veterans with localized PCa were used to assess treatment response. Among 92 269 veterans, African American men (n = 28 802 [31%]) were younger (median [IQR], 63 [58-68] vs 65 [62-71] years) and had higher prostate-specific antigen levels (>20 ng/mL) at the time of diagnosis compared with White men (n = 63 467; [69%]). Consistent with US population-level data, African American veterans displayed a nearly 2-fold greater incidence of localized and de novo metastatic PCa compared with White men across VA centers nationwide. Among veterans screened for PCa, African American men had a 29% increased risk of PCa detection on a diagnostic prostate biopsy compared with White (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27-1.31; P < .001). African American men who received definitive primary treatment of PCa experienced a lower risk of metastasis (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95; P < .001). However, African American men who received nondefinitive treatment classified as “other” were more likely to develop metastasis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < .001). Using the actual rate of metastasis from veterans who received definitive primary treatment, a persistent residual metastatic burden for African American men was observed across all National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk groups (low risk, 4 vs 2 per 100 000; intermediate risk, 13 vs 6 per 100 000; high risk, 19 vs 9 per 100 000).','This cohort analysis found significant disparities in the incidence of localized and metastatic PCa between African American veterans and White veterans. This increased incidence is a major factor associated with the residual disparity in PCa metastasis observed in African American veterans compared with White veterans despite their nearly equal response to treatment."
"Racial minorities are disproportionately affected by stroke, with Black patients experiencing worse poststroke outcomes than White patients. A modifiable aspect of acute stroke care delivery not yet examined is whether disparities in stroke outcomes are related to hospital nurse staffing levels.','The aim of this study was to determine whether 7- and 30-day readmission disparities between Black and White patients were associated with nurse staffing levels.','We conducted a secondary analysis of 542 hospitals in four states. Risk-adjusted, logistic regression models were used to determine the association of nurse staffing with 7- and 30-day all-cause readmissions for Black and White ischemic stroke patients.','Our sample included 98,150 ischemic stroke patients (87% White, 13% Black). Thirty-day readmission rates were 10.4% (12.7% for Black patients, 10.0% for White patients). In models accounting for hospital and patient characteristics, the odds of 30-day readmissions were higher for Black than White patients. A significant interaction was found between race and nurse staffing, with Black patients experiencing higher odds of 30- and 7-day readmissions for each additional patient cared for by a nurse. In the best-staffed hospitals (less than three patients per nurse), Black and White stroke patients' disparities were no longer significant.','Disparities in readmissions between Black and White stroke patients may be linked to the level of nurse staffing in the hospitals where they receive care. Tailoring nurse staffing levels to meet the needs of Black ischemic stroke patients represents a promising intervention to address systemic inequities linked to readmission disparities among minority stroke patients."
"Previous research found racial and ethnic disparities in meeting medication therapy management (MTM) eligibility criteria implemented by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in accordance with the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA).','To examine whether alternative MTM eligibility criteria based on the CMS Part D star ratings quality evaluation system can reduce racial and ethnic disparities.','This study analyzed the Beneficiary Summary File and claims files for Medicare beneficiaries linked to the Area Health Resource File. Three million Medicare beneficiaries with continuous Parts A, B, and D enrollment in 2012-2013 were included. Proposed star ratings criteria included 9 existing medication safety and adherence measures developed mostly by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. Logistic regression and the Blinder-Oaxaca approach were used to test disparities in meeting MMA and star ratings eligibility criteria across racial and ethnic groups. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine whether there was a disparity reduction by comparing individuals who were MTM-eligible under MMA but not under star ratings criteria and those who were MTM-eligible under star ratings criteria but not under the MMA. Concerning MMA-based MTM criteria, main and sensitivity analyses were performed to represent the entire range of the MMA eligibility thresholds reported by plans in 2009, 2013, and proposed by CMS in 2015. Regarding star ratings criteria, meeting any 1 of the 9 measures was examined as the main analysis, and various measure combinations were examined as the sensitivity analyses.','In the main analysis, adjusted odds ratios for non-Hispanic blacks (backs) and Hispanics to non-Hispanic whites (whites) were 1.394 (95% CI = 1.375-1.414) and 1.197 (95% CI = 1.176-1.218), respectively, under star ratings. Blacks were 39.4% and Hispanics were 19.7% more likely to be MTM-eligible than whites. Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to be MTM-eligible than whites in some sensitivity analyses. Disparities were not completely explained by differences in patient characteristics based on the Blinder-Oaxaca approach. The multinomial logistic regression of each main analysis found significant adjusted relative risk ratios (RRR) between whites and blacks for 2009 (RRR = 0.459, 95% CI = 0.438-0.481); 2013 (RRR = 0.449, 95% CI = 0.434-0.465); and 2015 (RRR = 0.436, 95% CI = 0.425-0.446) and between whites and Hispanics for 2009 (RRR = 0.559, 95% CI = 0.528-0.593); 2013 (RRR = 0.544, 95% CI = 0.521-0.569); and 2015 (RRR = 0.503, 95% CI = 0.488-0.518). These findings indicate a significant reduction in racial and ethnic disparities when using star ratings eligibility criteria; for example, black-white disparities in the likelihood of meeting MTM eligibility criteria were reduced by 55.1% based on star ratings compared with MMA in 2013. Similar patterns were found in most sensitivity and disease-specific analyses.','This study found that minorities were more likely than whites to be MTM-eligible under the star ratings criteria. In addition, MTM eligibility criteria based on star ratings would reduce racial and ethnic disparities associated with MMA in the general Medicare population and those with specific chronic conditions.','Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01AG049696.

"Indigenous women and children experience some of the most profound health disparities globally. These disparities are grounded in historical and contemporary trauma secondary to colonial atrocities perpetuated by settler society. The health disparities that exist for chronic diseases may have their origins in early-life exposures that Indigenous women and children face. Mechanistically, there is evidence that these adverse exposures epigenetically modify genes associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. Interventions designed to support a resilient pregnancy and first 1000 days of life should abrogate disparities in early-life socioeconomic status. Breastfeeding, prenatal care and early child education are key targets for governments and health care providers to start addressing current health disparities in cardiometabolic diseases among Indigenous youth. Programmes grounded in cultural safety and co-developed with communities have successfully reduced health disparities. More works of this kind are needed to reduce inequities in cardiometabolic diseases among Indigenous women and children worldwide."
"Recent research reveals that, although girls encounter some barriers in school (e.g., in science and math), on balance, boys perform worse academically. Moreover, other research has identified a correlation between exposure to a context characterized by large disparities in performance or resources and a range of negative outcomes, including negative health and well-being, among members of lower status groups.','Building on these literatures, the present research tests the relationship between gender disparities in academic performance within a school and students' health outcomes. Specifically, we investigated whether boys had worse health when they attended schools where there was a greater disparity between boys' and girls' academic performance.','We tested this hypothesis in two different samples with different health outcomes. In a sample of healthy eighth graders (Study 1; 159 girls and 81 boys), we assessed two indices of metabolic syndrome, and in a sample of children with asthma (Study 2; 122 girls and 153 boys), we assessed immune function (Th1 and Th2 cytokine production) and self-reported symptoms. Participants in both samples also reported the name of the school that they attended so that we could access publicly available information about the percentage of girls and the percentage of boys in each school who met expectations for their grade level on standardized tests.','In both samples, the greater the gap in a school between the percentage of girls and the percentage of boys who met expectations for their grade level on standardized tests, the worse boys' health. This pattern did not emerge among girls.','Results thus highlight the negative health correlates of academic disparities among members of lower-performing groups."
"Structural inequalities exist within healthcare. Racial disparities in hospital security standby requests (SSRs) have not been previously explored. We speculated hospital SSRs varied based upon race with black patients and their visitors negatively impacted.','An 8-year retrospective study of hospital security dispatch information was performed. Data were analyzed to determine demographic information, and service location patterns for SSRs involving patients and their visitors. The race of the patient's visitors was imputed using the patient's race. The observed and expected (using hospital census data) number of patients impacted by SSRs was compared. Descriptive statistics were computed. Categorical data were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher exact test statistic. A p < 0.05 was statistically significant.','The majority of the 1023 SSRs occurred for visitors of patients who were white (N = 642; 63%), female (56%), or < 21 years old (50.7%). However, SSRs differed significantly based upon the patient's race. Although Black patients represent 12% of the hospital population, they and their visitors were more than twice as likely (p < 0.0001) to have a SSR generated (N = 275; 27%) when compared to the visitors of both White and other (i.e., race unknown) patients (N = 106; 10%) combined (p < 0.0001).','This study adds to the medical errors and healthcare disparities literature by being the first to describe racial disparities in SSRs for Black patients and their visitors. It also introduces the concept of ""security intervention errors in healthcare environments."" New metrics and continuous quality improvement initiatives are needed to understand and eliminate racial/ethnic based disparities in SSRs."
"Age, sex, and racial/ethnic disparities exist, but are understudied in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to determine whether survival and treatment disparities persist after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Our study included PDAC patients diagnosed between 1992 and 2011. We used Cox regression to compare survival across age, sex, and race/ethnicity within early-stage and late-stage cancer subgroups, adjusting for marital status, urban location, socioeconomics, SEER region, comorbidities, stage, lymph node status, tumor location, tumor grade, diagnosis year, and treatment received. We used logistic regression to compare differences in treatment received across age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Among 20,896 patients, 84% were White, 9% Black, 5% Asian, and 2% Hispanic. Median age was 75; 56% were female and 53% had late-stage cancer. Among early-stage patients in the adjusted Cox model, older patient subgroups had worse survival compared with ages 66-69 (HR > 1.1, P < 0.01 for groups >69); no survival differences existed between sexes. Black (HR = 1.1, P = 0.01) and Hispanic (HR = 1.2, P < 0.01) patients had worse survival compared with White. Among late-stage cancer patients, patients over age 84 had worse survival than those aged 66-69 (HR = 1.1, P < 0.01), and males (HR = 1.08, P < 0.01) had worse survival than females; there were no racial/ethnic differences. Older age and minority race/ethnicity were associated with lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery. Age and racial/ethnic disparities in survival outcomes and treatment received exist for PDAC patients; these disparities persist after adjusting for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics."
"Our understanding of the mechanisms through which racial/ethnic disparities in disability in older adults develop and are maintained is limited. We examined the role of physical impairment, socioeconomic factors and health for racial/ethnic disparities in activities of daily living (ADL), and the modifying role of the indoor home environment. Data come from the National Health and Aging Trends Study ( N = 5,640), and negative binomial regression models were specified separately for men and women. Blacks and Hispanics reported more ADL difficulty than Whites. Living in homes with clutter was associated with higher rates of ADL difficulty, but it was not related to racial/ethnic disparities. Racial/ethnic differences were explained by physical impairment for men, but not for women. Socioeconomic factors and health accounted for remaining disparities for Black, but not for Hispanic women. Attention to individual and environmental factors is necessary to fully understand and address race/ethnic disparities in disability in older Americans."
"The coronavirus pandemic has disproportionally impacted racial and ethnic minority communities in the United States. Patterns of these disparities may be changing over time as outbreaks occur in different communities. Utilizing electronic health record data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), we estimated odds ratios, stratified by time period and region, for testing positive among 1,313,402 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 12, 2020 and August 16, 2021 at VA medical facilities. We adjusted for personal characteristics (sex, age, rural/urban residence, VA facility) and a wide range of clinical characteristics that have been evaluated in prior SARS-CoV-2 reports and could potentially explain racial/ethnic disparities in SARS-CoV-2. Our study found racial and ethnic disparities for testing positive were most pronounced at the beginning of the pandemic and decreased over time. A key finding was that the disparity among Hispanic individuals attenuated but remained elevated, while disparities among Asian individuals reversed by March 1, 2021. The variation in racial and ethnic disparities in SARS-CoV-2 positivity by time and region, independent of underlying health status and other demographic characteristics in a nationwide cohort, provides important insight for strategies to prevent further outbreaks."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in a rapid expansion of telehealth services in hepatology. However, known racial and socioeconomic disparities in internet access potentially translate into barriers for the use of telehealth, particularly video technology. The specific aim of this study was to determine if disparities in race or socioeconomic status exist among patients utilizing telehealth visits during COVID-19.','We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients evaluated in hepatology clinics at Duke University Health System. Visit attempts from a pre-COVID baseline period (January 1, 2020 through February 29, 2020; n = 3328) were compared to COVID period (April 1, 2020 through May 30, 2020; n = 3771).','On multinomial regression modeling, increasing age was associated with higher odds of a phone or incomplete visit (canceled, no-show, or rescheduled after May 30,2020), and non-Hispanic Black race was associated with nearly twice the odds of completing a phone visit instead of video visit, compared to non-Hispanic White patients. Compared to private insurance, Medicaid and Medicare were associated with increased odds of completing a telephone visit, and Medicaid was associated with increased odds of incomplete visits. Being single or previously married (separated, divorced, widowed) was associated with increased odds of completing a phone compared to video visit compared to being married.','Though liver telehealth has expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, disparities in overall use and suboptimal use (phone versus video) remain for vulnerable populations including those that are older, non-Hispanic Black, or have Medicare/Medicaid health insurance."
"This study was aimed to examine differences in infant mortality outcomes across maternal age subgroups less than 20 years in the United States with a specific focus on racial and ethnic disparities.','Using National Center for Health Statistics cohort-linked live birth-infant death files (2009-2013) in this cross-sectional study, we calculated descriptive statistics by age (<15, 15-17, and 18-19 years) and racial/ethnic subgroups (non-Hispanic white [NHW], non-Hispanic black [NHB], and Hispanic) for infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated by race/ethnicity and age. Preterm birth and other maternal characteristics were included as covariates.','Disparities were greatest for mothers <15 and NHB mothers. The risk of infant mortality among mothers <15 years compared to 18 to 19 years was higher regardless of race/ethnicity (NHW: aOR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.85; NHB: aOR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.56; Hispanic: aOR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.07-1.74). Compared to NHW mothers, NHB mothers had a consistently higher risk of infant mortality (15-17 years: aOR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21; 18-19 years: aOR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.15-1.27), while Hispanic mothers had a consistently lower risk (15-17 years: aOR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.66-0.78; 18-19 years: aOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.70-0.78). Adjusting for preterm birth had a greater influence than maternal characteristics on observed group differences in mortality. For neonatal and postneonatal mortality, patterns of disparities based on age and race/ethnicity differed from those of overall infant mortality.','Although infants born to younger mothers were at increased risk of mortality, variations by race/ethnicity and timing of death existed. When adjusted for preterm birth, differences in risk across age subgroups declined and, for some racial/ethnic groups, disappeared.','· Infant mortality risk was highest for adolescents <15 years old across racial/ethnic groups.. · Racial/ethnic disparities in timing of death were present even among the youngest adolescents.. · Infants of NHB adolescents had greatest risk of mortality, especially as age increased.. · Preterm birth influenced infant mortality risk, especially among NHB adolescents.."
"Numerous studies have demonstrated substantial differences in assisted reproductive technology outcomes between black non-Hispanic and white non-Hispanic women. We sought to determine if disparities in assisted reproductive technology outcomes between cycles from black non-Hispanic and white non-Hispanic women have changed and to identify factors that may have influenced change and determine racial differences in cumulative live birth rates.','This is a retrospective cohort study of the SARTCORS database outcomes for 2014-2016 compared with those previously reported in 2004-2006 and 1999/2000. Patient demographics, etiology of infertility, and cycle outcomes were compared between black non-hispanic and white non-hispanic patients. Categorical values were compared using Chi-squared testing. Continuous variables were compared using t-test. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess confounders.','We analyzed 122,721 autologous, fresh, non-donor embryo cycles from 2014 to 2016 of which 13,717 cycles from black and 109,004 cycles from white women. The proportion of cycles from black women increased from 6.5 to 8.4%. Cycles from black women were almost 3 times more likely to have tubal and/or uterine factor and body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that black women had a lower live birth rate (OR 0.71;P < 0.001) and a lower cumulative live birth rate for their initial cycle (OR 0.64; P < 0.001) independent of age, parity, body mass index, etiology of infertility, ovarian reserve, cycle cancellation, past spontaneous abortions, use of intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection or number of embryos transferred. A lower proportion of cycles in black women were represented among non-mandated states (P < 0.001) and cycles in black women were associated with higher clinical live birth rates in mandated states (P = 0.006).','Disparities in assisted reproductive technology outcomes in the US have persisted for black women over the last 15 years. Limited access to state mandated insurance may be contributory. Race has continued to be an independent prognostic factor for live birth and cumulative live birth rate from assisted reproductive technology in the US."
"Little is known about the persistence of health disparities in joint arthroplasty. The objective of this study was to update our knowledge on the state of racial and ethnic disparities in total hip arthroplasty (THA).','Patients undergoing primary, elective THA using the 2011-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program were retrospectively reviewed. Five minority groups (non-Hispanic black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander) were compared with non-Hispanic whites. The primary outcomes were in the differences in demographic characteristics, comorbidities, perioperative characteristics, THA utilization, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day adverse events (mortality, readmission, reoperation, and complications).','A total of 155,870 patients were identified with racial and ethnic data available on 134,961 (86.6%) of them. Non-Hispanic white patients comprised 74.5% of all THA procedures. Except for Asians, all minority groups were more likely to be younger, have a higher body mass index, and smoke tobacco (<i>P</i> < .001). There were higher rates of nonprimary osteoarthritis, procedure length exceeding 100 minutes, and comorbidities among all minority groups. All minority groups, except Asian and Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, were more likely to require an LOS >2 days. Blacks were more likely to develop surgical or medical complications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.21 and 1.2, respectively), whereas Hispanics or Latinos were more likely to develop surgical complications (OR: 1.28). American Indians or Alaska Natives were more likely to undergo reoperations (OR: 1.91).','Health disparities persist among minority groups with respect to comorbidities, THA utilization, LOS, and complications. Blacks and Hispanics or Latinos appear to be the most impacted by these disparities."
"Socioeconomic and treatment factors contribute to diagnosis of early-stage (local-stage) breast cancer, as well as excess deaths among African American women.','We evaluated socioeconomic and treatment predictive factors for early-stage breast cancer among African American women compared to Caucasian women. A secondary aim evaluated predictors and overall risks associated with all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality.','We used retrospective cohort population-based study data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program on 547,703 women aged ≥ 20 years diagnosed with breast cancer primary tumors from 2007 to 2016. Statistical analysis used logistic regression to assess predictors of early-stage breast cancer and Cox proportional hazards regression for mortality risks.','African American women were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced-stage, had larger tumor size at diagnosis, and received less cancer-directed surgery, but more chemotherapy than Caucasian women. Insured women (> 50%) were more likely to be diagnosed at early-stage and to have smaller tumors (p < 0.05). Education level, poverty level, and household income had no impact on racial disparities or socioeconomic disparities in women diagnosed at early stage. We found increased risks for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.21) and breast cancer-specific mortality (HR = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.25) among African American women compared to Caucasian women after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and treatment factors.','In this population-based study using the most recent SEER data, African American women with breast cancer continued to exhibit higher all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality compared to Caucasian women."
"Racial disparities exist for endometrial cancer. We examined patterns of care and factors associated with poor outcomes for Black women with endometrial cancer.','We studied 110,826 endometrial cancer patients diagnosed between 1980 and 2008 with minimum 5years follow-up in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Trends over time in sociodemographics, disease characteristics and treatment factors were analyzed over four eras: 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2008. Using sequential Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models we determined the association between potential explanatory variables and racial disparities in all-cause mortality (ACM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM), respectively.','Clinical characteristics of Black and White women were relatively constant over time. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) among Black women for ACM and CSM were 1.91 (95% CI 1.86-1.97) and 2.35 (95% CI 2.26-2.43), respectively. Adjustment for sociodemographics, disease presentation and surgery decreased the ACM HR to 1.29 (95% CI 1.24-1.34) and CSM HR to 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.26) without further decrease from controlling for radiotherapy. Black women were less likely to undergo operative management even when prescribed. Total and radical hysterectomy, and vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) were associated with improved ACM and CSM. Combination VBT and external beam radiotherapy was associated with improved ACM.','Racial disparities in endometrial cancer survival are predominantly attributable to increased advanced stage, high-grade and aggressive histologic subtype tumors and differential use of surgery in Black women. Intensified surgical and radiation treatment is associated with improved survival, raising questions about treatment adaptations that may potentially reduce survival disparities."
"Pregnant women are at increased risk of hospitalization, serious complications, poor pregnancy outcomes, and mortality from influenza. Prior research suggests that there are racial/ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage and that a healthcare provider vaccination recommendation is associated with significantly higher vaccine uptake than without such a recommendation. The purpose of this study is to examine racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare providers' recommendations for pregnant women to receive the influenza vaccine and in vaccine uptake.','This cross-sectional population-based study analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) during 2012-2015 (n = 130161). Both healthcare provider recommendation and vaccine uptake were assessed dichotomously. Logistic regression was conducted to ascertain adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, controlling for maternal age, marital status, education, prenatal care utilization, and smoking status.','Influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy ranged from 39.1% among non-Hispanic (NH) Black women to 55.4% among NH Asian women. In the adjusted analysis, NH Black and NH Asian women had 19% (95% CI 0.75-0.86) and 34% (95% CI 0.61-0.72) decreased odds of receiving a provider recommendation for influenza vaccine during pregnancy, respectively, compared to NH White women. For influenza vaccine uptake, NH Black women were 30% less likely (95% CI 0.65-0.74) to receive influenza vaccine during pregnancy compared to NH White women.','Our findings indicate that there are racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare provider recommendation and influenza vaccine uptake among pregnant women in the United States. Targeted efforts toward providers and interventions focusing on pregnant women may be warranted to reduce the disparity."
"The potential for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the racial disparities in HIV incidence in the United States might be limited by racial gaps in PrEP care. We used a network-based mathematical model of HIV transmission for younger black and white men who have sex with men (BMSM and WMSM) in the Atlanta, Georgia, area to evaluate how race-stratified transitions through the PrEP care continuum from initiation to adherence and retention could affect HIV incidence overall and disparities in incidence between races, using current empirical estimates of BMSM continuum parameters. Relative to a no-PrEP scenario, implementing PrEP according to observed BMSM parameters was projected to yield a 23% decline in HIV incidence (hazard ratio = 0.77) among BMSM at year 10. The racial disparity in incidence in this observed scenario was 4.95 per 100 person-years at risk (PYAR), a 19% decline from the 6.08 per 100 PYAR disparity in the no-PrEP scenario. If BMSM parameters were increased to WMSM values, incidence would decline by 47% (hazard ratio = 0.53), with an associated disparity of 3.30 per 100 PYAR (a 46% decline in the disparity). PrEP could simultaneously lower HIV incidence overall and reduce racial disparities despite current gaps in PrEP care. Interventions addressing these gaps will be needed to substantially decrease disparities."
"Previous studies have addressed racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) within the Medicare population. However, there is limited research examining these disparities across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the general population. This study used administrative data from the State Inpatient Databases from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for the years 2007-2014 from California (2007-2011 only), Florida, New York, and Maryland (2012-2014 only). In all, 739,857 TKA readmission-eligible patients aged ≥8 years were included in the analysis. Black patients and patients with Medicaid had a higher likelihood of 30- and 90-day readmissions compared to white patients and patients with private insurance, respectively. Patients living in higher median income areas and patients treated at higher volume hospitals had lower likelihoods of 30- and 90-day readmissions compared to patients in the lowest median income quartile and patients treated at the lowest volume hospitals, respectively. These results confirmed racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in TKA readmissions across 4 geographically diverse states, identified public insurance status as the salient factor across subpopulations, and raise awareness of the existence of these disparities outside of the Medicare population."
"Many healthcare disparities studies use the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess bias. Despite ongoing controversy around the IAT, its use has enabled researchers to reliably document an association between provider implicit prejudice and provider-to-patient communication (provider communication behaviors and patient reactions to them). Success in documenting such associations is likely due to the outcomes studied, study settings, and data structure unique to racial/ethnic healthcare disparities research. In contrast, there has been little evidence supporting the role of providers' implicit bias in treatment recommendations. Researchers are encouraged to use multiple implicit measures to further investigate how, why, and under what circumstances providers' implicit bias predicts provider-to-patient communication and treatment recommendations. Such efforts will contribute to the advancement of both basic social psychology/social cognition research and applied health disparities research: a better understanding of implicit social cognition and a more comprehensive identification of the sources of widespread racial/ethnic healthcare disparities, respectively."
"Asthma disparities have complex, neighborhood-level drivers that are not well understood. Consequently, identifying particular contextual factors that contribute to disparities is a public health goal. We study pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) visit disparities and neighborhood factors associated with them in South Carolina (SC) census tracts from 1999 to 2015. Leveraging a Bayesian framework, we identify risk clusters, spatially-varying relationships, and risk percentile-specific associations. Clusters of high risk occur in both rural and urban census tracts with high probability, with neighborhood-specific associations suggesting unique risk factors for each locale. Bayesian methods can help clarify the neighborhood drivers of health disparities."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in systemic sclerosis are abundant. The incidence, severity of end-organ manifestations, functional impairment, quality of life, and mortality of systemic sclerosis vary by ethnic group. This article summarizes such disparities and explores the role of socioeconomic status in their development and persistence."
"Health disparities are associated with poor outcomes related to public health. The objective of this study was to assess health disparities associated with influenza infection based on median household income and educational attainment.','We geocoded people with documented confirmed influenza infection by home address to identify the US Census 2010 tract in which they lived during 4 influenza surveillance seasons (2013-2014, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018) in Rhode Island. We dichotomized influenza as severe if the person with influenza infection was hospitalized (ie, inpatient) or as nonsevere if the person was not hospitalized (ie, outpatient). We examined 2 socioeconomic factors: median household income (defined as low, medium low, medium high, and high) and educational attainment (defined as a ratio among people who completed <high school, high school, some college, or ≥bachelor's degree). We calculated relative rates (RRs) to determine the associated level of risk for each socioeconomic factor.','The incidence of influenza per 100 000 person-years was significantly higher in populations with low vs high median household income (620 vs 303; <i>P</i> < .001) and in populations with low vs high educational attainment (583 vs 323; <i>P</i> < .001). The RR of a severe infection in the quartile with the lowest educational attainment (0.57) was significantly higher than the RR in the other 3 quartiles of educational attainment (range, 0.36-0.39; <i>P</i> = .01). However, the RR of a severe infection was higher in the 3 quartiles of median household income (range, 0.38-0.40) than in the quartile with the lowest median household income (0.29).','People in Rhode Island with a lower socioeconomic status are at greater risk of an influenza infection than people with higher socioeconomic status. The reasons for these disparities require further investigation."
"Young children living in low-income households experience disparities in language development compared to their advantaged peers, with large differences in language skill by kindergarten entry. In this study, we sought to determine whether there were disparities in early language trajectories within a low-income sample of children from 9 to 36 months as a function of maternal education. We hypothesized that children with more highly educated mothers would show accelerated language trajectories compared to children with less educated mothers.','Using observational data collected from a longitudinal birth-cohort sample of 192 low-income mother-infant dyads in Ohio from 2014 to 2018, children's language skills were assessed at three time-points (ages 9-13 months, 20-24 months, and 32-36 months). Multi-level growth curve models were used to examine early language trajectories through three years of age as a function of maternal education.','Multilevel growth curve models showed distinct language trajectories: young low-income children have significantly better language skills at 15 months if their mother had a college education compared to not, and this gap remained significant to almost 3 years of age.','Among young low-income children, disparities emerge in early language trajectories that differentiate children with less- versus more-educated mothers. Given that these disparities are apparent near the child's first birthday, it is necessary that pediatric care providers monitor children's early language trajectories and guide families to resources when lags are apparent."
" Maternal race and ethnicity have been identified as significant independent predictors of obstetric morbidity and mortality in the United States. An appreciation of the clinical contexts in which maternal racial and ethnic disparities are most pronounced can better target efforts to alleviate these disparities and improve outcomes. It remains unknown whether cesarean delivery precipitates these divergent outcomes.',' This study assessed the association between maternal race and ethnicity and cesarean complications.',' We conducted a retrospective cohort study from a multicenter observational cohort of women undergoing cesarean delivery. Nulliparous women with non-anomalous singleton gestations who underwent primary cesarean section were included. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or unknown. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal cesarean complications including hysterectomy, uterine atony, blood transfusion, surgical injury, arterial ligation, infection, wound complication, and ileus. A composite of neonatal morbidity was evaluated as a secondary outcome. We created a multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for selected demographic and obstetric variables that may influence the likelihood of the primary outcome.',' A total of 14,570 women in the parent trial met inclusion criteria with an 18.8% incidence of the primary outcome (2,742 women). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, maternal surgical morbidity was found to be significantly higher for non-Hispanic Black (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 1.96, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 1.63-2.35) and Hispanic (aOR 1.66, 95% CI 1.37-2.01) women as compared with non-Hispanic white women. Neonatal morbidity was similarly found to be significantly associated with the Black race and Hispanic ethnicity.',' In this cohort, the odds of cesarean-related maternal and neonatal morbidity were significantly higher for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women. These findings suggest race as a distinct risk factor for cesarean complications, and efforts to alleviate disparities should highlight cesarean section as an opportunity for improvement in outcomes.','· Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women experienced more cesarean complications than non-Hispanic White women.. · These findings suggest that disparities in maternal and neonatal outcomes exist specifically following cesarean section.. · Efforts to alleviate disparities in obstetrics should highlight cesarean section as an opportunity for improvement.."
" The aim of this study was to assess whether racial disparities in rates of and indications for cesarean delivery (CD) between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White birthing people in California changed from 2011 to 2017.',' This was a retrospective cohort study using a database of birth certificates linked to discharge records. Singleton term live births in nulliparous Black and White birthing people in California between 2011 and 2017 were included. Those with noncephalic presentation, placenta previa, and placenta accreta were excluded. CD rate and indication were obtained from birth certificate variables and International Classification of Diseases codes. Differences in CD rate and indication were calculated for Black versus White individuals using univariable and multivariable logistic regression and adjusted for potential confounders.',' A total of 348,144 birthing people were included, 46,361 Black and 301,783 White. Overall, 30.9% of Black birthing people underwent CD compared with 25.3% of White (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.3). From 2011 to 2017, the CD rate fell 11% (26.4-23.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) for White birthing people and 1% for Black birthing people (30.4-30.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.037). Over the study period, Black birthing people had a persistent 1.2- to 1.3-fold higher risk of CD and were persistently more likely to undergo CD for fetal intolerance (aRR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.1-1.2) and less likely for active phase arrest or arrest of descent (aRRs: 0.9 and 0.4; 95% CIs: 0.9-0.9 and 0.3-0.5).',' The CD rate decreased substantially for White birthing people and minimally for Black birthing people in our cohort over the study period. Meanwhile, disparities in CD rate and indications between the two groups persisted, despite controlling for confounders. Although care bundles for reducing CD may be effective among White birthing people, they are not associated with reduction in CD rates among Black birthing people nor improvements in racial disparities between Black and White birthing people.',' Despite increasing attention to racial inequities in obstetric outcomes, there were no changes in disparities in CD rates or indications in California from 2011 to 2017.','· Black birthing people are more likely to undergo CD than White despite controlling for confounders.. · There are unexplained differences in CD indication among Black and White birthing people.. · These disparities persisted from 2011 to 2017 despite increasing efforts to decrease CD rates in CA.."
"To investigate the presence of ethnic and socio-economic disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) screening and identify its impact on cancer outcomes.','From January 2008 to December 2017, all men in the Northern region of New Zealand who had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test performed in the community were identified from the electronic laboratory reports database. Asymptomatic men, with no known diagnosis of PCa, were included. Variables collected were age, ethnicity, social deprivation, medical therapy, PSA test information and cancer data. Disparities were investigated by comparing the frequency of PSA testing, proportions of men screened, and rates of cancer detection, between Māori (indigenous) and non-Māori ethnic groups.','The study cohort included 248 491 men, who each received approximately 3.45 PSA tests over the 10-year study period. Māori men were less likely to be tested compared to non-Māori men (25.4% vs 46.1% of the total aged-matched region population; P < 0.001). Moreover, they received less frequent PSA testing irrespective of their deprivation status (mean difference of 0.97 PSA tests per person; P < 0.001). The higher testing frequency in non-Māori men was associated with increased PCa diagnosis rates. Nevertheless, cancers detected in Māori men were 73% more likely to be of high grade (Gleason 8 or above), compared to those in non-Māori men.','There were significant ethnic disparities in PCa screening rates in the Northern region of New Zealand. Māori men, regardless of other demographic factors, were disproportionately affected. The difference in the rates of screening by ethnicity had influenced the incidence and clinical significance of the diagnosed cancers."
"<i>Background</i>: One justification for marijuana legalization has been to reduce existing disparities in marijuana-related arrests for African Americans. <i>Objective</i>: Describe changes in adult marijuana arrest rates and disparities in rates for African Americans in Washington State (WA) after legalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana for 21+ year olds in December 2012, and after marijuana retail market opening in July 2014. <i>Methods</i>: We used 2012-2015 National Incident Based Reporting System data to identify marijuana-related arrests. Negative binomial regression models were fit to examine monthly marijuana arrest rates over time, and to test for differences between African Americans and Whites, adjusting for age and sex. <i>Results</i>: Among those 21+ years old overall, marijuana arrest rates were dramatically lower after legalization of possession, and did not change significantly after the retail market opened. The marijuana arrest rates for African Americans did drop markedly and the absolute disparities decreased, but the <i>relative</i> disparities grew: from a rate 2.5 times higher than Whites to 5 times higher after the retail market opened. Among 18-20 year olds overall, marijuana arrest rates dropped, but not as dramatically as among older adults; the absolute disparities decreased, but the relative disparities did not change significantly. <i>Conclusions</i>: Marijuana arrest rates among both African American and White adults decreased significantly with legalization of possession, and stayed at a dramatically lower rate after the marijuana retail market opened. However, relative disparities in marijuana arrest rates for African Americans increased for those of legal age, and remained unchanged for younger adults."
"In the United States, the number of people with Hispanic backgrounds is rapidly increasing. This growth, along with other factors, may put them at increased risk for healthcare disparities. Thus, physical medicine and rehabilitation should evaluate disparities in health services through the lens of the evidence base. To our knowledge, this is the first review describing the literature on healthcare disparities for Hispanic patients in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. This review explores healthcare utilization, risk factors, access, and health conditions specific to Hispanic populations. Articles used in this narrative review were collected for a 10-yr span (2009-2018) from online databases.Our findings highlight disparities across common conditions and injuries in the physical medicine and rehabilitation literature, including poststroke rehabilitation, hip fracture treatment and rehabilitation, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. Our review suggests that Hispanic patients may be at risk for worse outcomes after these conditions, because of low access to rehabilitation services and disparities in the referral process. Similar results are reported for pain management and Parkinson disease. As we strive to provide optimal care to an increasingly diverse patient population, researchers and clinicians must consider effects of race and ethnicity on access to and utilization of rehabilitation services."
"Racial/ethnic, gender, and age disparities in access to renal transplantation among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have been well documented, but few studies have explored health care staff attitudes towards these inequalities. Staff perceptions can influence patient care and outcomes, and identifying staff perceptions on disparities could aid in the development of potential interventions to address these health inequities. The objective of this study was to investigate dialysis staff (n = 509), primarily social workers and nurse managers, perceptions of renal transplant disparities in the Southeastern United States.','This is a mixed methods study that uses both deductive and inductive qualitative analysis of a dialysis staff survey conducted in 2012 using three open-ended questions that asked staff to discuss their perceptions of factors that may contribute to transplant disparities among African American, female, and elderly patients.','Study results suggested that the majority of staff (n = 255, 28%) perceived patients' low socioeconomic status as the primary theme related to why renal transplant disparities exist between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Staff cited patient perception of old age as a primary contributor (n = 188, 23%) to the disparity between young and elderly patients. The dialysis staff responses on gender transplant disparities suggested that staff were unaware of differences due to limited experience and observation (n = 76, 14.7%) of gender disparities.','These findings suggest that dialysis facilities should educate staff on existing renal transplantation disparities, particularly gender disparities, and collaboratively work with transplant facilities to develop strategies to actively address modifiable patient barriers for transplant."
"The prevalence of childhood obesity is significantly higher among racial and/or ethnic minority children in the United States. It is unclear to what extent well-established obesity risk factors in infancy and preschool explain these disparities. Our objective was to decompose racial and/or ethnic disparities in children's weight status according to contributing socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors.','We used nationally representative data from ∼10 700 children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort who were followed from age 9 months through kindergarten entry. We assessed the contribution of socioeconomic factors and maternal, infancy, and early childhood obesity risk factors to racial and/or ethnic disparities in children's BMI <i>z</i> scores by using Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analyses.','The prevalence of risk factors varied significantly by race and/or ethnicity. African American children had the highest prevalence of risk factors, whereas Asian children had the lowest prevalence. The major contributor to the BMI <i>z</i> score gap was the rate of infant weight gain during the first 9 months of life, which was a strong predictor of BMI <i>z</i> score at kindergarten entry. The rate of infant weight gain accounted for between 14.9% and 70.5% of explained disparities between white children and their racial and/or ethnic minority peers. Gaps in socioeconomic status were another important contributor that explained disparities, especially those between white and Hispanic children. Early childhood risk factors, such as fruit and vegetable consumption and television viewing, played less important roles in explaining racial and/or ethnic differences in children's BMI <i>z</i> scores.','Differences in rapid infant weight gain contribute substantially to racial and/or ethnic disparities in obesity during early childhood. Interventions implemented early in life to target this risk factor could help curb widening racial and/or ethnic disparities in early childhood obesity."
"The present study examined educational disparities in mortality for 49 states and the District of Columbia in the United States based on the 2010-2014 national mortality data. A total of 3,165,762 deaths at ages 25-74years were included in analysis. Absolute and relative disparities were estimated as Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII), respectively, based on age-standardized death rates by education, race/ethnicity sex, and state. We found that educational disparities in mortality existed in every US state with varying magnitude across states and by sex. The disparities were generally larger in men than in women on both absolute and relative scales. Across states, for all races combined, the RII varied in the range of 4.2 to 14.9 in men and 3.2 to 10.1 in women; the SII (1/100,000 persons) ranged from 934.0 to 1633.4 in men and from 333.7 to 672.5 in women. Hispanic origin seems to alter the pattern of educational disparities by state. In non-Hispanic whites, some Midwest states had the smallest disparities on both relative and absolute scales. Maryland, Virginia, and Massachusetts had a large relative disparity but a moderate absolute disparity. In general, southern states had a large absolute disparity but a moderate relative disparity. There was a strong correlation (0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.79) between educational disparities in mortality and disparities in combined major risk factors (smoking, obesity, and hypertension) by state. These findings call for tailored interventions among socially disadvantaged populations, especially in high disparity states and among young adults."
"To examine disparities in use and access to different health care providers by community and individual race-ethnicity and to test provider supply as a potential mediator.','National secondary data from 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 5-year estimates (2010-2014) from American Community Survey, and 2014 InfoUSA.','Multiple logistic regression models examined the association of community and individual race-ethnicity with reported health care visits and access. Mediation analyses tested the role of provider supply.','Individual-level survey data were linked to race-ethnic composition and health business counts of the respondent's primary care service area (PCSA).','Minority PCSAs are significantly and independently associated with lower odds of having a visit to a physician assistant/nurse practitioner, dentist, or other health professionals and having a usual care provider (all p < 0.05). Few significant associations were observed for integrated PCSAs or for health provider supply. A modest mediation effect for provider supply was observed for travel time to usual care provider and visit to other health professionals.','Use of a range of health services is lower in minority communities and individuals. However, provider supply was not an important explanatory factor of these disparities."
"Progress to address health care equity requires health care providers' commitment, but their engagement may depend on their perceptions of the factors contributing to inequity. To understand providers' perceptions of causes of racial health care disparities, a short survey was delivered to health care providers who work at 3 Veterans Health Administration sites, followed by qualitative interviews (N = 53). Survey data indicated that providers attributed the causes of disparities to social and economic conditions more than to patients' or providers' behaviors. Qualitative analysis revealed differences in the meaning that participants ascribed to these causal factors. Participants who believed providers contribute to disparities discussed race and racism more readily, identified the mechanisms through which disparities emerge, and contextualized patient-level factors more than those who believed providers contributed less to disparities. Differences in provider understanding of the underlying causal factors suggest a multidimensional approach to engage providers in health equity efforts."
"This themed issue focuses on understanding and addressing several public health issues affecting communities today nationally and internationally. Health disparities, and global health in general, cover a large breadth of health concerns impossible to address in one issue. Here we provide a scope of some health disparities while focusing on health promotion and well-being of diverse populations, specifically within urban undeserved populations, rural communities in Peru, Roma minorities in Spain, and refugee communities. We focus on understanding contextual issue that affect health disparities as well as on examining the effectiveness of community-based interventions and community coalitions designed to address disparities."
"Racial disparities in health are persistent and pervasive in the United States. Researchers and policymakers have known for decades that access to health care is not sufficient for addressing health disparities because of the socially situated roots of the disparities. We argue that the lack of progress in alleviating health disparities is the result of a lack of overarching framework to guide both policymakers and researchers in their efforts. We propose Amartya Sen's capabilities approach as a theoretical framework that is expansive enough to address both the social context in which health occurs as well as the quality of health care provided. In this article, we use a subset of veterans receiving care from the Veterans Health Administration to review the theoretical concepts that link social inequalities with health disparities. Next, we provide empirical evidence of disparities in health based on race within the Veterans Health Administration, and we then provide a theoretical explanation for those disparities that exist at a system level. We close with a detailed examination of the applicability of the capabilities approach in addressing health disparities in the United States."
"Background To address disparities in lung cancer screening (LCS) that may exclude large numbers of high-risk African American smokers, revised U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations lowered LCS eligibility thresholds. However, there are limited recent data about the impact of newly revised guidelines on disparities in LCS eligibility. Purpose To evaluate the impact of revised USPSTF guidelines on racial and ethnic disparities in LCS eligibility. Materials and Methods Cross-sectional survey data from 20 states were retrospectively evaluated from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (median response rate, 49.4%). Respondents without a history of lung cancer aged 55-79 years (ie, under the previous guidelines) or aged 50-79 years (ie, under the revised guidelines) were included. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between race and ethnicity and LCS eligibility. All analyses were performed accounting for complex survey design features (ie, weighting, stratification, and clustering). Results Under previous guidelines, 11% of 67 567 weighted survey respondents were eligible for LCS (White [12%], Hispanic [4%], African American [7%], American Indian [17%], Asian or Pacific Islander [4%], and other [12%]). Under revised USPSTF guidelines, 14% of 77 689 weighted survey respondents were eligible for LCS (White [15%], Hispanic [5%], African American [9%], American Indian [21%), Asian or Pacific Islander [5%], and other [18%]). Compared with White respondents, African American respondents (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.47; <i>P</i> < .001) and Hispanic respondents (adjusted OR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.24; <i>P</i> < .001) were less likely to be eligible for LCS under previous guidelines. African American respondents (adjusted OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.47; <i>P</i> < .001) and Hispanic respondents (adjusted OR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.23; <i>P</i> < .001) were less likely to be eligible under the revised guidelines. The Wald test showed no evidence of differences in the degree to which racial and ethnic minority groups were less likely to be eligible for LCS when comparing previous versus revised USPSTF guidelines (<i>P</i> = .76). Conclusion The revised U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines (version 2.0) may perpetuate lung cancer disparities, as racial and ethnic minority groups are still less likely to be eligible for lung cancer screening. © RSNA, 2021 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i> See also the editorial by Jacobs and Springfield in this issue."
"Emergency department (ED) triage scores are assigned to patients in a short period based on assessment of need for lifesaving measures, risk and pain levels, resource needs, and vital signs. Racial/ethnic disparities have been found across a number of outcomes but are not consistent across all studies. This study examines pediatric ED cases reporting fever, a commonly reported triage symptom, to explore racial/ethnic and age disparities in triage score assignment.','This study uses the 2009-2015 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual national sample of ED visits in the United States. Pediatric cases where fever is the sole reported reason for visit are analyzed for racial/ethnic disparities, controlling for sex, age, insurance status, body temperature, region, and hospital type.','Among all pediatric fever cases, temperature is the sole significant predictor of triage scores. However, non-Hispanic (NH) black pediatric patients older than 1 year have approximately 22% greater risk of being given a less urgent triage score relative to NH white patients.','Findings suggest racial disparities in the triage of NH black pediatric patients older than 1 year for fever. Although fever is a single and often non-life-threatening condition, especially after infancy, findings of racial disparities in triage scores suggests a need for further evaluation of the assignment of patient urgency in emergency medicine."
"To conduct a systematic review of published evidence on clozapine prescribing disparities across racial and ethnic categories, estimate the size of these disparities, and assess possible causes to inform future monitoring and intervention.','Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were searched for directly relevant studies. Three independent reviewers selected studies: (1) of US samples; (2) directly addressed ethnic and/or racial disparities in prescribing of antipsychotic medications; (3) identified specific ethnic and/or racial groups (e.g. White, Blacks, Hispanics, non-Hispanic etc.); (4) reported clozapine prescription rates and (5) reported relevant covariates (i.e. gender, age, co-morbidities etc.).','16 studies met our eligibility criteria. All studies reported clozapine underutilization in ethnic and racial minority patients when compared to their white counterparts. These findings remained consistent despite different time periods, designs, data set types, and after controlling for relevant covariates such as: length of hospital stay, institutional setting, and disease severity.','The reasons for underutilization of clozapine in minority patients remain unclear. Various contributors can be categorized as: clinician-related factors (e.g. prescriber lack of experience), patient-related factors (e.g. distrust or suspicion of clinician), and institution-related factors (e.g. state operated facilities). Direct examination of these factors can help inform efforts to reduce clozapine prescription disparities."
"Diabetes prevalence and incidence vary by neighborhood socioeconomic environment (NSEE) and geographic region in the United States. Identifying modifiable community factors driving type 2 diabetes disparities is essential to inform policy interventions that reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.','This paper aims to describe the Diabetes Location, Environmental Attributes, and Disparities (LEAD) Network, a group funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to apply harmonized epidemiologic approaches across unique and geographically expansive data to identify community factors that contribute to type 2 diabetes risk.','The Diabetes LEAD Network is a collaboration of 3 study sites and a data coordinating center (Drexel University). The Geisinger and Johns Hopkins University study population includes 578,485 individuals receiving primary care at Geisinger, a health system serving a population representative of 37 counties in Pennsylvania. The New York University School of Medicine study population is a baseline cohort of 6,082,146 veterans who do not have diabetes and are receiving primary care through Veterans Affairs from every US county. The University of Alabama at Birmingham study population includes 11,199 participants who did not have diabetes at baseline from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a cohort study with oversampling of participants from the Stroke Belt region.','The Network has established a shared set of aims: evaluate mediation of the association of the NSEE with type 2 diabetes onset, evaluate effect modification of the association of NSEE with type 2 diabetes onset, assess the differential item functioning of community measures by geographic region and community type, and evaluate the impact of the spatial scale used to measure community factors. The Network has developed standardized approaches for measurement.','The Network will provide insight into the community factors driving geographical disparities in type 2 diabetes risk and disseminate findings to stakeholders, providing guidance on policies to ameliorate geographic disparities in type 2 diabetes in the United States.','DERR1-10.2196/21377."
"A series of policy changes in 2011 altered reimbursement arrangements and guidance on use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with anaemia in the US. While the policy changes were principally directed at care delivered in an outpatient setting, these had the potential to affect inpatient care also. This study used HCUP-NIS data (2008-2016) to examine trends in recorded anaemia among ESRD hospitalizations and analyse disparities in inpatient outcomes among ethnic groups following policy changes.','The International Classification of Diseases codes were used to identify ESRD admissions, recorded anaemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to generate an age-adjusted Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index. Linear splines with a knot placed at the time point of policy changes and multivariable logistic regression were used to examine the likelihood of recorded anaemia, adjusted for a range of socio-demographic and clinical covariates. Difference-in-difference analyses investigated the impact of policies on recorded anaemia. Other outcomes included hospital cost, mortality and place of discharge.','The percentage of inpatient episodes with recorded anaemia arising from CKD increased from 26.2% in 2008 to 50.0% in 2016. Anaemia was more likely to be recorded as a complication of ESRD among minority ethnic groups and Native American admissions, in particular, (OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.15-1.25) relative to White American admissions; and these disparities widened following changes to reimbursement. Minorities were less likely to die in hospital and to be discharged to another healthcare facility, and (with the exception of Black American admissions) they were more expensive to treat.','Our findings provide evidence of an increase in recorded anaemia consistent with a shift of patients from outpatient to inpatient settings in the wake of changes to reimbursement enacted in 2011. In addition, the study highlights the existence of ethnic disparities that widened after the policy initiated reimbursement changes."
"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) populations have an increased risk of multiple adverse health outcomes. Capturing patient data on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) in the electronic health record (EHR) can enable healthcare organizations to identify inequities in the provision of preventive health screenings and other quality of care services to their LGBTQ patients. However, organizations may not be familiar with methods for analyzing and interpreting SOGI data to detect health disparities.','To assess an approach for using SOGI EHR data to identify potential screening disparities of LGBTQ patients within distinct healthcare organizations.','Five US federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) retrospectively extracted three consecutive months of EHR patient data on SOGI and routine screening for cervical cancer, tobacco use, and clinical depression. The screening data were stratified across SOGI categories. Chi-Square and Fisher's Exact test were used to identify statistically significant differences in screening compliance across SOGI categories within each FQHC.','In all FQHCs, cervical cancer screening percentages were lower among lesbian/gay patients than among bisexual and straight/heterosexual patients. In three FQHCs, cervical cancer screening percentages were lower for transgender men than for cisgender (i.e., not transgender) women. Within each FQHC, we observed statistically significant associations (P < 0.05) between SOGI categories and at least one screening measure. The small number of transgender patients, and limitations in EHR functionality, created challenges in interpretation of SOGI data.','To our knowledge, this is the first published report of using SOGI data from EHRs to detect potential disparities in healthcare services to LGBTQ patients. Our finding that lesbian/gay and transgender male patients had lower cervical cancer screening rates compared to heterosexual, bisexual, and cisgender women, is consistent with the research literature and suggests that using SOGI EHR data to detect preventive screening disparities has value. EHR functionality should allow for cross-checking gender identity with sex assigned at birth to reduce errors in data interpretation. Additional functionality, like clinical decision support based on anatomical inventories rather than gender identity, is needed to more accurately identify services that transgender patients need."
"Clinical trials have long established the long-term safety of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in patients with clinically node-negative early stage breast cancer. The variations in utilization of SLND and ALND in this patient population, however, are currently unknown.','Adult female patients (40 years and older) within the National Cancer Database diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2013 and December 2015, who had clinical T1-T2 and N0 disease, and who underwent either SLND (with or without subsequent ALND) or ALND were included. Differences in utilization across race, ethnicity, insurance type, facility, and residential characteristics were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.','Overall, 271,689 patients were included, of which 26,527 (10%) received ALND and 245,162 (90%) underwent SLND. After adjusting for demographics and cancer characteristics, black (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06-1.17) and Hispanic women (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.10-1.24) were more likely to receive ALND. Patients without health insurance (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.19-1.47), compared with private health insurance, and those receiving treatment at community cancer centers (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.53-1.67), compared with academic/research centers, were also more likely to receive ALND.','Although the vast majority of women undergo SLND, significant disparities exist in its utilization for early stage breast cancer, with traditionally underserved patients receiving unwarranted extensive axillary surgery. Increased patient and surgeon education is needed to decrease variations in care that can affect patient's quality of life."
"Network factors have been proposed as potential drivers of racial disparities in HIV among Black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM). This review aimed to synthesize the extant literature on networks and racial disparities in HIV among MSM and identify potential directions for future research. We searched databases for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2008 and July 1, 2018. Articles were included if the sample was comprised primarily of racial/ethnic minority MSM and measured one or more network characteristics. (n = 25). HIV prevalence in networks, social support, and structural barriers were linked to disparities in HIV for Black MSM. Future research should focus on intervention development around social support and other strategies for risk reduction within networks. Given the contribution of structural factors to racial/ethnic HIV disparities, network-level interventions should be paired with policies that improve access to housing, jobs, and education for MSM."
"Reports continue to show that Blacks with curable lung or breast cancer complete treatment less often than similar Whites contributing to worse survival. ACCURE is an intervention trial designed to address this problem.','A pragmatic, quality improvement trial comparing an intervention group to retrospective and concurrent controls. Patients with early stage breast or lung cancer aged 18 to 85 were enrolled (N = 302) at 2 cancer centers between April 2013 and March 2015 for the intervention component. Data from patients seen between January 2007 and December 2012 with these diagnoses were obtained to establish control completion rates. Concurrent data for non-study patients were used to identify secular trends. The intervention included: a real time registry derived from electronic health records of participants to signal missed appointments or unmet care milestones, a navigator, and clinical feedback. The primary outcome was ""Treatment Complete"", a composite variable representing completion of surgery, recommended radiation and chemotherapy for each patient.','The mean age in the intervention group was 63.1 years; 37.1% of patients were Black. Treatment completion in retrospective and concurrent controls showed significant Black-White differences (Blacks (B) 79.8% vs. Whites (W) 87.3%, p < 0.001; 83.1% B vs. 90.1% W, p < 0.001, respectively). The disparity lessened within the intervention (B 88.4% and W 89.5%, p = 0.77). Multivariate analyses confirmed disparities reduction. OR for Black-White disparity within the intervention was 0.98 (95% CI 0.46-2.1); Black completion in the intervention compared favorably to Whites in retrospective (OR 1.6; 95% CI 0.90-2.9) and concurrent (OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.59-2.0) controls.','A real time registry combined with feedback and navigation improved completion of treatment for all breast and lung cancer patients and narrowed disparities. Similar multi-faceted interventions could mitigate disparities in the treatment of other cancers and chronic conditions."
"Due to growing health disparities, federal and philanthropic agencies have empha-sized reducing health disparities in their preventive health efforts. This study determined the status of disparities in health behaviors in the last 13 years in the United States.','Data were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Systems in odd years (2003-2015). Health behaviors were dichotomized to reflect met fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption and physical activity (PA) recommendations, non-cigarette smoking, non-heavy drinking, and non-binge drinking. Overall and sociodemographic characteristic-specific disparities ratios for each behavior were calculated. Linear trend analyses were calculated to determine disparities change across the years.','Overall disparities fluctuated across the years. Linear trend analyses confirmed that education-specific and income-specific disparities' contribution to overall disparities increased for all behaviors. Sex-specific disparities' contribution decreased for all behaviors except non-cigarette smoking. Age-specific disparities' contribution decreased for all behaviors except non-binge drinking. Race/ethnicity-specific disparities' contribution to overall disparities increased for FV and non-cigarette smoking, but decreased for the other behaviors.','The results suggest health disparities in preventive health behaviors in the last 13 years have not improved. Tailored interventions, systemic and policy changes, and/or inclusive population efforts should be initiated to reduce disparities in preventive health for the most- divergent groups identified in the results."
"Purpose Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival in the United States are well documented, but the underlying causes are not well understood. We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24% of disparities in breast cancer, 24% in prostate cancer, and 16% to 30% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15% to 40% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors."
"Cardiovascular disparities remain pervasive in the United States. Unequal disease burden is evident among population groups based on sex, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, nativity, or geography. Despite the significant declines in cardiovascular disease mortality rates in all demographic groups during the last 50 years, large disparities remain by sex, race, ethnicity, and geography. Recent data from modeling studies, linked micromap plots, and small-area analyses also demonstrate prominent variation in cardiovascular disease mortality rates across states and counties, with an especially high disease burden in the southeastern United States and Appalachia. Despite these continued disparities, few large-scale intervention studies have been conducted in these high-burden populations to examine the feasibility of reducing or eliminating cardiovascular disparities. To address this challenge, on June 22 and 23, 2017, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened experts from a broad range of biomedical, behavioral, environmental, implementation, and social science backgrounds to summarize the current state of knowledge of cardiovascular disease disparities and propose intervention strategies aligned with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute mission.

"Many studies have suggested that disparities exist in the use of medical screening tests. The purpose of this study was to assess racial disparities in screening mammography in the United States via a systematic review and meta-analysis.','We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus for comparative studies published between 1946 and 2015 comparing utilization of mammography among various racial groups. Two independent reviewers extracted data and appraised study. Meta-analysis was conducted when appropriate using the random-effects model.','A total of 5,818,380 patients were included across 39 relevant studies; 43.1% of patients were white, 33.3% were black, 17.4% were Hispanic, and 6.2% were Asian/Pacific Islander. Black and Hispanic populations had lower odds of utilizing screening mammography when compared with the white population (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.91; I<sup>2</sup> = 89.4% and OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.93, respectively). For African Americans, these disparities were present in both the 40 to 65 age group and the >65 age group; for Hispanics, these differences were present only in the 40 to 65 age group. There was no difference in mammography utilization between Asians/Pacific Islanders and whites (OR = 1.82; 95% CI, 0.09-38.41).','Racial disparities in utilization of screening mammography are evident in black and Hispanic populations in the United States. Further studies are needed to understand reasons for disparities, trends over time, and the effectiveness of interventions targeting these disparities."
"It is currently estimated that nearly one-third of patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have stage I-II disease on clinical evaluation. Curative-intent surgical resection has been a cornerstone of the therapeutic management of such patients, offering the best clinical and oncologic outcomes in the long-term. In 1999, Peter Bach and colleagues brought attention to racial disparities in the receipt of curative-intent surgery in the NSCLC population. In the time since this seminal study, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that disparities in the receipt of definitive surgery continue to persist for patients with early stage NSCLC. In this review, we sought to provide an up-to-date assessment of 20 years of surgical disparities literature in the NSCLC population. We summarized common and unrecognized disparities in the receipt of surgical resection for early stage NSCLC and demonstrated that demographic and socioeconomic factors such as race/ethnicity, special patient groups, income and insurance continue to impact the receipt of definitive resection. Additionally, we found that discrepancies in patient and provider perceptions of and attitudes toward surgery, access to invasive staging, distance to treatment centers and negative stigmas about lung cancer that patients experience may act to perpetuate disparities in surgical treatment of early stage lung cancer."
"Socio-economic disparities in preterm delivery have often been attributed to socially patterned smoking habits. However, most existing studies have used methods that potentially give biased estimates of the mediating effect of smoking. We used a contemporary mediation approach to study to which extent smoking during pregnancy mediates educational disparities in preterm delivery.','We performed a comparative analysis of data from three large birth cohort studies: the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), the Dutch Generation R Study, and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Risk of preterm delivery by maternal education is reported as risk differences and decomposed into a part explained by smoking and a part explained by other pathways.','Proportions of preterm singleton deliveries were 4.8%-4.9% in all three cohorts. Total effects of maternal education were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 2.5), 3.2 (95% CI 0.8, 5.2) and 2.0 (95% CI 0.9, 3.0) excess preterm deliveries per 100 singleton deliveries in DNBC, Generation R and MoBa when comparing primary/lower secondary education to an academic degree or equivalent. Smoking mediated, respectively, 22%, 10% and 19% of the excess risk in the DNBC, Generation R and MoBa cohorts. Adjustment for potential misclassification of smoking only increased mediated proportions slightly.','Smoking during pregnancy explains part of educational disparities in preterm delivery, but the mediated proportion depends on the educational gradient in smoking, emphasising that educational disparities in preterm birth may be mediated by different risk factors in different countries."
"Medication nonadherence is a significant, modifiable contributor to uncontrolled hypertension. Stereotype threat may contribute to racial disparities in adherence by hindering a patient's ability to actively engage during a clinical encounter, resulting in reduced activation to adhere to prescribed therapies.','The Hypertension and Values (HYVALUE) trial aims to examine whether a values-affirmation intervention improves medication adherence (primary outcome) by targeting racial stereotype threat.','The HYVALUE trial is a patient-level, blinded randomized controlled trial comparing a brief values-affirmation writing exercise with a control writing exercise among black and white patients with uncontrolled hypertension. We are recruiting patients from 3 large health systems in the United States. The primary outcome is patients' adherence to antihypertensive medications, with secondary outcomes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure over time, time for which blood pressure is under control, and treatment intensification. We are comparing the effects of the intervention among blacks and whites, exploring possible moderators (ie, patients' prior experiences of discrimination and clinician racial bias) and mediators (ie, patient activation) of intervention effects on outcomes.','This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Enrollment and follow-up are ongoing and data analysis is expected to begin in late 2020. Planned enrollment is 1130 patients. On the basis of evidence supporting the effectiveness of values affirmation in educational settings and our pilot work demonstrating improved patient-clinician communication, we hypothesize that values affirmation disrupts the negative effects of stereotype threat on the clinical interaction and can reduce racial disparities in medication adherence and subsequent health outcomes.','The HYVALUE study moves beyond documentation of race-based health disparities toward testing an intervention. We focus on a medical condition-hypertension, which is arguably the greatest contributor to mortality disparities for black patients. If successful, this study will be the first to provide evidence for a low-resource intervention that has the potential to substantially reduce health care disparities across a wide range of health care conditions and populations.','ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03028597; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03028597 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/72vcZMzAB).','DERR1-10.2196/12498."
"More than 10 million lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons live in the United States. Improving their health is a public health priority. LGBT persons have specific health concerns and face health care disparities. Awareness of those issues and disparities can enable dermatologists to provide medically appropriate and culturally competent care to LGBT patients. This review highlights terminology important in caring for LGBT persons, LGBT demographics in the United States, health care disparities faced by LGBT persons, and approaches to caring for LGBT patients."
"Geographic differences have existed in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and efforts to reduce regional disparities have been initiated. The aim of this study is to use the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to determine if regional disparities in the treatment of HCC continue to exist.','A retrospective database analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was performed that included patients with a primary diagnosis of HCC. Logistic regression models were utilized to determine geographic disparities in liver decompensation, treatment, inpatient mortality, and metastatic disease.','This study's locational reach of 62 604 patients included 22 769 patients from the South (36%), 14 554 in the Northeast (23%), 14 041 in the West (22%), and 11 240 in the Midwest (18%). Patients who received treatment in the West were more likely to have inpatient mortality (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.53) than patients who received treatment in the Midwest. No significant differences were observed between rates of resection, ablation, and transarterial chemoembolization when comparing by region. Rates of liver transplantation were lower in the West compared with the Midwest (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29, 0.87). There was no significant difference between other regions.','Geographic disparities in the treatment of HCC are improving."
"Interhospital transfer (IHT) is often performed to provide patients with specialized care. Racial/ethnic disparities in IHT have been suggested but are not well-characterized.','To evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and IHT.','Cross-sectional analysis of 2016 National Inpatient Sample data.','Patients aged ≥ 18 years old with common medical diagnoses at transfer, including acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, sepsis, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleed.','We performed a series of logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds of transfer by race/ethnicity controlling for patient demographics, clinical variables, and hospital characteristics and to identify potential mediators. In secondary analyses, we estimated adjusted odds of transfer among patients at community hospitals (those more likely to transfer patients) and performed subgroup analyses by region and primary medical diagnosis.','Of 5,774,175 weighted hospital admissions, 199,015 (4.5%) underwent IHT, including 4.7% of White patients, compared with 3.9% of Black patients and 3.8% of Hispanic patients. Black (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89) and Hispanic (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87) patients had lower crude odds of transfer compared with White patients, but this became non-significant after adjusting for hospital-level characteristics. In secondary analyses among patients hospitalized at community hospitals, Hispanic patients had lower adjusted odds of transfer (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-0.98). Disparities in IHT by race/ethnicity varied by region and medical diagnosis.','Black and Hispanic patients had lower odds of IHT, largely explained by a higher likelihood of being hospitalized at urban teaching hospitals. Racial/ethnic disparities in transfer were demonstrated at community hospitals, in certain geographic regions and among patients with specific diseases."
"Disparities in breast cancer survival by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status have been reported. However, it is unclear if these findings are reproducible among subpopulations. This study aimed to assess if socially oriented factors are predictive of overall survival (OS) among patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>), human epidermal growth factor 2-positive (HER2<sup>+</sup>) metastatic breast cancer (MBC).','We analyzed patients with MBC included in the National Cancer Database diagnosed with HR<sup>+</sup> and HER2<sup>+</sup> disease treated between 2010 and 2015. Multivariate analyses describe the association between non-clinical prognostic factors and OS. A matched analysis, which balanced prognostic factors between whites and African Americans (AA), was also conducted.','Of the 6200 patients analyzed, the majority were 50 years or older, white, and treated with hormonal therapy. Disparities in OS were observed; multivariate analysis revealed diminished survival was associated with low income (< $38K vs. ≥ $63K, hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; P < .001), having government insurance (government vs. private, HR, 1.55; P < .001), living closer to one's treatment facility (< 4 miles vs. ≥ 18 miles, HR, 1.16; P = .04), and being AA (AA vs. white, HR, 1.20; P = .006). The mortality disparity attributed to race was insignificant in the matched analysis (AA vs. white, HR, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.30; P = .09).','This study confirms that the known sociodemographic disparities in OS among patients with MBC are similar within the HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>+</sup> subpopulation. The discordance of outcomes between matched and unmatched analysis demonstrate that there is a highly vulnerable subgroup of AAs. Further investigation is required to determine if the identified associations are independently causal of poor prognosis."
"Both social and genetic factors are associated with health outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), thus playing a role in its health disparities. Despite the growing list of social and genetic factors associated with SLE outcomes, studies integrating sociocultural and individual determinants of health to understand health disparities in SLE are lacking. We review the contributions of different social and genetic factors to the disparities in SLE, and propose a socioecological model to integrate and examine the complex interactions between individual and social factors in SLE outcomes.','Multiple studies collecting comprehensive social data and biospecimens from diverse populations are underway, which will contribute to the elucidation of the interplay and underlying mechanisms by which positive and negative social determinants of health influence epigenomic variation, and how the resulting biological changes may contribute to the lupus health disparities.','There is growing awareness of the need to integrate genomic and health disparities research to understand how social exposures affect disease outcomes. Understanding the contributions of these factors to the SLE health disparity will inform the development of interventions to eliminate risk exposures and close the health disparity gap."
"Compared with traditional Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA) has the potential to reduce racial disparities in hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC). As racial disparities may be partly attributable to unequal treatment based on where people live, this suggests the need of examining geographic variations in racial disparities.','The aim of this study was to examine differences in ACSC hospitalizations between White and Black beneficiaries in TM and MA and examine geographic variations in racial differences in ACSC hospitalizations in TM and MA.','We analyzed the 2015-2016 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files. We used propensity score matching to account for differences in characteristics between TM and MA beneficiaries. Then, we conducted linear regression and estimated adjusted outcomes for TM and MA beneficiaries by race. Also, we estimated racial differences in adjusted outcomes by insurance and hospital referral region (HRR).','While White beneficiaries in TM and MA had similar rates of ACSC hospitalizations (163.7 vs. 162.2/10,000 beneficiaries), Black beneficiaries in MA had higher rates of ACSC hospitalizations than Black beneficiaries in TM (221.2 vs. 209.3/10,000 beneficiaries). However, the racial differences were greater in MA than TM (59.0 vs. 45.6/10,000 beneficiaries). Racial differences in ACSC hospitalizations in MA were prevalent across almost all HRRs. 95.5% of HRRs had higher rates of ACSC hospitalizations among Black beneficiaries than White beneficiaries in MA relative to just 54.2% of HRRs in TM.','Our findings provide evidence of racial disparities in access to high-quality primary care, especially in MA."
"The Chicago south side, even more so than national populations, continues to be burdened with widening gaps of disparities in cancer outcomes. Therefore, Chicago community members were engaged in addressing the following content areas for a cancer disparities curriculum: (1) the south side Chicago community interest in participating in curriculum design, (2) how community members should be involved in designing cancer disparities curriculum, and (3) what community members believe the curriculum should address to positively impact their community.','Eighty-six community members from 19 different zip code areas of Chicago attended the deliberative session. A survey composed of three quantitative and three short-answer content questions was analyzed.','The majority of participants were from the south side of Chicago (62 %) and females (86 %). Most, 94 %, believed community members should be involved in cancer disparities curriculum development. Moreover, 56 % wanted to be involved in designing the curriculum, and 61 % reported an interest in taking a course in cancer disparities. Three categorical themes were derived from the qualitative questions: (1) community empowerment through disparities education-""a prescription for change,"" (2) student skill development in community engagement and advocacy training, and (3) community expression of shared experiences in cancer health disparities.','The community provided valuable input for curricular content and has an interest in collaborating on cancer disparities curriculum design. Community participation must be galvanized to improve disparities curricular development and delivery to successfully address the challenges of eliminating disparities in health."
"The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased steadily in the last decades in the United States. The aim of this paper was to characterize disparities in esophageal cancer treatment in different racial and socioeconomic population groups and compare long-term survival among different treatment modalities. A retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database was performed including adult patients (≥18 years old) with a diagnosis of resectable (stages I-III) esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. In conclusion, underserved patients with esophageal cancer appear to have limited access to surgical care, and are, in fact, more likely to not be offered any treatment at all. Considering the survival benefits associated with surgical resection, greater public health efforts to reduce disparities in esophageal cancer are needed."
"The phenomenon of urban-rural segmentation has emerged and is remarkable, and the health disparities between rural and urban China should be stressed.','Based on data from the Chinese General Social Survey from 2005 to 2013, this study not only explored the net age, period, and cohort effects of self-rated health, but compared these effects between rural and urban China from a dynamic perspective through hierarchical age-period-cohort-cross-classified random effects model.','Urban-rural disparities, as well as work status and gender disparities in health increased with age, in line with the cumulative advantage/disadvantage effects theory, while marital status disparities in health declining with age was in line with the age-as-leveler effects theory. The war cohort, famine cohort, later cultural revolution cohort, and early reform cohort had poorer health than did those in the early China cohort, economic recovery cohort, and later reform cohort. The economic crisis period, war cohort, baby boomer, and early cultural revolution cohort encountered larger urban-rural health disparities, while the early China cohort and early reform cohort experienced smaller urban-rural disparities in health.','Population health is closely related to social context and health care development. It is necessary to keep economic development stable and boost medical technology improvements and the construction of the health care system."
"The Government of Canada has proposed an 'endgame' target for cigarette smoking that aims to reduce prevalence below 5% by 2035. To meet this difficult goal, it will be necessary to identify populations where interventions will (1) have the greatest impact in reducing the number of smokers and (2) have the greatest impact in addressing smoking disparities.','Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, smoking prevalence was estimated for populations that differed with respect to demographic, substance use, and mental health factors. Risk difference, relative risk, and attributable disparity number, which describes the magnitude of the potential impact if the disparity were addressed, were calculated for each group.','The strongest disparities (relative risk ⩾ 2) were associated with immigration status (for women), substance use, marital status, and lifetime experience of mental health or substance use disorders. The smallest disparities (relative risk ⩽ 1.5) were associated with sexual orientation, household income, immigration status (men), and province of residence. The groups with the largest attributable disparity number were among those who used cannabis, and those who were not immigrants, not married, and white.','Disparities which were both strong and had a large potential impact on prevalence overall were found for populations facing mental health and substance use concerns. Differences in rankings were found depending on the scale of the measure. Addressing disparities in smoking rates is an important component of developing tobacco endgame strategies."
"<b>Purpose:</b> There is growing concern that value-based payment for health care may disadvantage health care organizations that serve populations with social risk. In the broader investigation of social risk factors, including income, education, neighborhood deprivation, and other risks, the focus on race and ethnicity as a risk factor for disparities in health and health care has diminished. Understanding the independent contribution of minority group status is critical to this discussion. This narrative review discusses four concepts-minority stress, resilience, epigenetics, and life course-that may help explain the contribution of minority group status and its association with health disparities. <b>Methods:</b> We briefly describe each concept and the supporting evidence. <b>Results:</b> Our results indicate that all four concepts have potential relevance for understanding and addressing health disparities. The life course perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding explanatory mechanisms and factors that contribute to health-including biological, physical, and social factors-over a person's life span. Both minority stress and resilience may influence health in either a negative or positive manner that potentially underlies health changes. Exposure to these factors and others may interact with and modify epigenetic regulation-biological processes that impact how our genes are expressed. This may increase the risk of disease and negative health outcomes, particularly among groups that may be at disproportionate risk because of social circumstances and environmental exposure over the life course. <b>Conclusion:</b> Despite these concepts' relevance, more research is needed to assess how they may explain the relationship between minority status and disparities in health. Such evidence is needed to focus interventions and to inform the design of delivery and payment models that can spur actions to reduce disparities."
"Health care providers are in a unique position to address patients' health behaviors and social determinants of health, factors like income and social support that can significantly impact health. There is a need to better understand the risk behaviors of a population that providers may counsel (i.e., those who are insured and have a provider.) Using the 2015 and 2016 CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we examine the prevalence of health behaviors and the existence of disparities in health behaviors based on social determinants among American adults. Our sample included noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 to 64 years, in the U.S. (N > 300,000). We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the independent effects of income, education, sex, race, and metropolitan status on nine key health behaviors. Among adults with insurance and a provider (n > 200,000): 1) rates of engaging in poor health behaviors ranged from 6.4% (heavy drinking) to 68.1% (being overweight or obese), 2) rural residence, lower income, and lower education were associated with decreased clinical preventive services, 3) lower income and lower education were associated with lifestyle-related risks, and 4) being black was associated with receiving more cancer screenings, no influenza vaccination, inadequate physical activity, and being overweight or obese. Insured adults, with a provider, are not meeting recommended guidelines for health behaviors. Significant disparities in health behaviors related to social factors exist among this group. Health care providers and organizations may find it helpful to consider these poor health behaviors and disparities when determining strategies to address SDOH."
"Prior studies have reported that community health centers perform as well as other sites of care, despite serving more vulnerable patient populations. However, there is little prior study of geographic variation in quality outcomes and disparities in outcomes in this setting. Quantifying geographic variation is important so as to target quality improvement efforts and funding and to learn from states where total quality is highest and racial/ethnic disparities are lowest.','To estimate between-state variation in hypertension, diabetes, and pregnancy outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in these outcomes for health center patients.','Using data on all US health centers from 2010 to 2014 (N=1047 health centers/year, or 21.2 million patients in 2014), we used linear regression models to estimate adjusted quality outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in quality outcomes by state for hypertension control, diabetes control, and normal birthweight.','We found wide variation in both outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes between states for patients seen at health centers. For instance, between states, the mean proportion of patients with hypertension control ranged from 58% to 70% for white patients, from 49% to 64% for black patients, and from 53% to 74% for Hispanic patients (P<0.001). Racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes ranged from negative or nonsignificant in some states to positive in others.','Wide variation in health center patient outcomes and disparities in outcomes is observed between states. This variation suggests that policymakers should target funding and interventions to underperforming states, and identify determinants of high quality in higher performing states."
"Mounting evidence indicates that there are mental health disparities in the United States that disadvantage racial/ethnic minorities in medical and mental health settings. Less is known, however, about how these findings apply to a particularly vulnerable population, individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). The aim of this paper is to (1) provide a critical review of the literature on racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care among individuals with SMI; (2) identify factors which may contribute to the observed disparities; and (3) generate recommendations on how best to address these disparities. Specifically, this article provides an in-depth review of sociocultural factors that may contribute to differences in treatment engagement and rates of attrition from treatment among racial/ethnic minorities with SMI who present at medical and mental health facilities. This review is followed by a discussion of specific strategies that may promote engagement in mental health services and therefore reduce racial/ethnic disparities in SMI."
"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a cancer of the mesothelial lining of the pleura that has traditionally been associated with asbestos exposure in an industrial setting. Asbestos usage has fortunately been banned or phased out in most industrialized countries resulting in its decline in countries such as the United States. Despite this, MPM continues to place significant burden on its affected patients resulting in overall poor prognosis and survival. Questions arise as to what factors, especially what health disparities, contribute to the disease's dismal prognosis. This article will present a narrative review of recent literature that identifies the impact age, sex, race, access to medical centers, and economics have on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of MPM. As will be discussed, research has shown that factors including younger age, female sex, non-white race, private insurance, Medicare, and higher income have been associated with better survival in MPM. Whereas older age, male sex, white race, lack of insurance, and lower income are associated with worse survival. The identification of these and other health disparities related to MPM may allow for future research, clinical guidelines, and policies to be implemented to decrease the burden health disparities create in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with MPM."
"Childhood overweight and obesity are a primary social and public health concern. Over the past 30 years, rates of childhood overweight and obesity in the United States of America (USA) have drastically increased, particularly among Black and Latino/a populations. However, they tend to be underrepresented in the childhood obesity literature. This study expands previous literature by identifying different BMI growth trajectories for Black, Latino/a, and White children from birth to age nine. This study found a high prevalence rate of overweight and obesity in a predominantly low-income minority group. Using growth-based trajectory modeling, this study also found different growth trajectories by racial/ethnic groups, with Latino/a children having the most concerning growth trajectories from birth to 9 years. These findings demonstrate that ethnic/racial disparities in childhood overweight and obesity start as early as birth, indicating the need to devote more attention from researchers and health policy-makers to address these disparities as early as possible."
"To review research on breast cancer mortality disparities, emphasizing research conducted in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, with a focus on challenges and opportunities for integration of tumor biology and access characteristics across the cancer care continuum.','Black women experience higher mortality following breast cancer diagnosis, despite lower incidence compared to white women. Biological factors, such as stage at diagnosis and breast cancer subtypes, play a role in these disparities. Simultaneously, social, behavioral, environmental, and access to care factors are important. However, integrated studies of biology and access are challenging and it is uncommon to have both data types available in the same study population. The central emphasis of Phase 3 of the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, initiated in 2008, was to collect rich data on biology (including germline and tumor genomics and pathology) and health care access in a diverse study population, with the long term goal of defining intervention opportunities to reduce disparities across the cancer care continuum.','Early and ongoing research from CBCS has identified important interactions between biology and access, leading to opportunities to build greater equity. However, sample size, population-specific relationships among variables, and complexities of treatment paths along the care continuum pose important research challenges. Interdisciplinary teams, including experts in novel data integration and causal inference, are needed to address gaps in our understanding of breast cancer disparities."
"This introduction to the special issue on Addressing Health Disparities in Pediatric Psychology provides context for why this special issue is needed, reviews key findings of the accepted articles, and discusses future directions for advancing the field. This special issue, one of three on this topic area that has been put forth in the history of this journal, comes at a critical point in our world. This is a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is systematically infecting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and when there has been increased attention to systemic racism and intersecting violence inherent in multiple systems, including the justice, health, and educational systems. Using Kilbourne et al. (2016) framework, this special issue focuses on Phase 2 and Phase 3 research. Rather than only identifying health disparities (Phase 1), this issue focuses on understanding mechanisms and translating such understanding into interventions and policy changes. The accepted articles span a wide gamut from obesity to autism to rural populations. Furthermore, the articles provide methods for advancing the field beyond simply noting that systematic differences exist toward strategies to address these inequities. We conclude this introduction by discussing next steps for future research, with hopes that it inspires the next generation to study issues of disparities and inequity in deeper, more meaningful, and impactful ways."
"Improving the collection and quality of race and ethnicity reported in hospital data is a key step in identifying disparities in health service utilization and outcomes and opportunities for quality improvement.','The objective of this study was to assess the quality of race/ethnicity reported in hospital discharge data and examine the impact on the identification of disparities in select health outcomes in New York City.','Using the birth certificate as a gold standard, we examined the quality of hospital discharge race/ethnicity and estimated the impact of misclassification on racial/ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and preventable hospitalizations.','Delivery hospitalizations from the New York State hospital discharge data (Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System) linked with 2015 New York City birth certificates.','Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV).','The non-Hispanic white and black race had relatively high sensitivity and PPV. Hispanic ethnicity and Asian race had moderate sensitivity and high PPV, but were often misclassified as ""Other."" As a result, health disparities may be underestimated for those of Hispanic ethnicity and Asian race, particularly for indicators that use population denominators drawn from another source.','The quality of hospital discharge data varies by race/ethnicity and may underestimate disparities in some groups. Future research should validate findings with other data sources, identify driving factors, and evaluate progress over time."
"The 2014 pancreas allocation system (PAS) intended to decrease geographic variability in listing practices for simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplant and define eligibility criteria for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our primary aims were to evaluate geographic disparities in access to SPK and assess T2DM SPK listings in the pre- and post-PAS eras.','Adult listings for SPK and kidney transplant (pre-PAS, January 2010 to October 29, 2014; post-PAS, October 30, 2014, to June 2, 2017) were identified in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Multivariable logistic regression models tested associations of geography and/or diabetes mellitus type on the likelihood of SPK versus kidney transplant listing pre- and post-PAS. Competing risk models tested the likelihood of SPK transplantation within 2 years of listing for SPK.','Among 41 205 listings (27 393 pre-PAS; 24 439 T2DM), univariate analysis showed reduced percentages for SPK post-PAS (22.1%-20.8%; P = 0.003). After adjusting for patient and center characteristics, geographic disparities declined slightly but persisted post-PAS (era by region interaction P < 0.001). The era by type of diabetes mellitus interaction effect was statistically significant (P = 0.039), reflecting that the proportions of SPK listings for T2DM increased in the post-PAS era (3.4%-3.9%; univariate P = 0.038), while those for type 1 diabetes mellitus remained statistically stable (47.9%-48.4%; univariate P = 0.571). Among people listed for SPK, geographic disparities in the cumulative incidence of transplantation within 2 years declined and the overall likelihood of transplantation increased in the post-PAS era (both P < 0.001).','Geographic disparities in access to SPK declined slightly but persisted post-PAS. With new allocation change proposals and elimination of listing criteria for T2DM, further monitoring is warranted."
"During the Great Recession in America, African-Americans opted to forgo healthcare more than other racial/ethnic groups. It is not understood whether disparities in forgone care returned to pre-recession levels. Understanding healthcare utilization patterns is important for informing subsequent efforts to decrease healthcare disparities. Therefore, we examined changes in racial disparities in forgone care before, during, and after the Great Recession.','Data were pooled from the 2006-2013 National Health Interview Survey. Forgone medical, mental, and prescription care due to affordability were assessed among African-Americans and Whites. Time periods were classified as: pre-recession (May 2006-November 2007), early recession (December 2007-November 2008), late recession (December 2008-May 2010) and post-recession (June 2010-December 2013). Multivariable logistic regressions of race, interacted with time periods, were used to identify disparities in forgone care controlling for other demographics, health insurance coverage, and having a usual place for medical care across time periods. Adjusted Wald tests were performed to identify significant changes in disparities across time periods.','The sample consisted of 110,746 adults. African-Americans were more likely to forgo medical care during the post- recession compared to Whites (OR = 1.16, CI = 1.06, 1.26); changes in foregone medical care disparities were significant in that they increased in the post-recession period compared to the pre-recession (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.08, 1.28 and OR = 0.89, CI = 0.77, 1.04, respectively, adjusted Wald Test p-value < 0.01). No changes in disparities were seen in prescription and mental forgone care.','A persistent increase in forgone medical care disparities existed among African-Americans compared to Whites post-Great Recession and may be a result of outstanding issues related to healthcare access, cost, and quality. While health insurance is an important component of access to care, it alone should not be expected to remove these disparities due to other financial constraints. Additional strategies are necessary to close remaining gaps in care widened by the Great Recession."
"Mitochondria, which are multi-functional, have been implicated in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis due to metabolic alterations in transformed cells. Mitochondria are involved in the generation of energy, cell growth and differentiation, cellular signaling, cell cycle control, and cell death. To date, the mitochondrial basis of cancer disparities is unknown. The goal of this review is to provide an understanding and a framework of mitochondrial determinants that may contribute to cancer disparities in racially different populations. Due to maternal inheritance and ethnic-based diversity, the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) contributes to inherited racial disparities. In people of African ancestry, several germline, population-specific haplotype variants in mtDNA as well as depletion of mtDNA have been linked to cancer predisposition and cancer disparities. Indeed, depletion of mtDNA and mutations in mtDNA or nuclear genome (nDNA)-encoded mitochondrial proteins lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and promote resistance to apoptosis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and metastatic disease, all of which can contribute to cancer disparity and tumor aggressiveness related to racial disparities. Ethnic differences at the level of expression or genetic variations in nDNA encoding the mitochondrial proteome, including mitochondria-localized mtDNA replication and repair proteins, miRNA, transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases, and tumor suppressors and oncogenes may underlie susceptibility to high-risk and aggressive cancers found in African population and other ethnicities. The mitochondrial retrograde signaling that alters the expression profile of nuclear genes in response to dysfunctional mitochondria is a mechanism for tumorigenesis. In ethnic populations, differences in mitochondrial function may alter the cross talk between mitochondria and the nucleus at epigenetic and genetic levels, which can also contribute to cancer health disparities. Targeting mitochondrial determinants and mitochondrial retrograde signaling could provide a promising strategy for the development of selective anticancer therapy for dealing with cancer disparities. Further, agents that restore mitochondrial function to optimal levels should permit sensitivity to anticancer agents for the treatment of aggressive tumors that occur in racially diverse populations and hence help in reducing racial disparities."
"Little is known about the awareness of public health professionals regarding racial and ethnic disparities in health in the United States of America (USA). Our study objective was to assess the awareness and perceptions of a group of public health workers in Texas regarding racial health disparities and their chief contributing causes.','We surveyed public health professionals working on a statewide grant in Texas, who were participants at health disparities' training workshops. Multivariable logistic regression was employed in examining the association between the participants' characteristics and their perceptions of the social determinants of health as principal causes of health disparities.','There were 106 respondents, of whom 38 and 35 % worked in health departments and non-profit organizations, respectively. The racial/ethnic groups with the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS and hypertension were correctly identified by 63 and 50 % of respondents, respectively, but only 17, and 32 % were knowledgeable regarding diabetes and cancer, respectively. Seventy-one percent of respondents perceived that health disparities are driven by the major axes of the social determinants of health. Exposure to information about racial/ethnic health disparities within the prior year was associated with a higher odds of perceiving that social determinants of health were causes of health disparities (OR 9.62; 95 % CI 2.77, 33.41).','Among public health workers, recent exposure to information regarding health disparities may be associated with their perceptions of health disparities. Further research is needed to investigate the impact of such exposure on their long-term perception of disparities, as well as the equity of services and programs they administer."
"This paper compares black-white health disparities among state prisoners to disparities in the noninstitutionalized community to provide a more complete portrait of the nation's heath. We use data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities and the 2002 and 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for incarcerated and noninstitutionalized adult (aged 18 to 65) men and women, respectively. Health disparities between black and white male prisoners based on self-reported prevalence are similar to disparities in the general population for hypertension and diabetes but significantly reduced for kidney problems and stroke. Health disparities between black and white female prisoners are similar to disparities in the general population for obesity but significantly reduced for hypertension, diabetes, heart problems, kidney problems, and stroke. Our study reveals that prisoners report far worse health profiles than non-prisoners but there is differential health selection into prison for whites and blacks, and population health estimates for adult black men in particular are underreporting the true health burden for U.S. adults. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating prison populations in demographic and public health analyses."
"This is a literature review where we acknowledge Richard Allen Williams, the first African American physician to win the John P. McGovern Compleat Physician Award, and recognize his achievements in race and ethnicity in healthcare. There have been significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease; however, racial disparities continue to create inequity in the medical community especially for African Americans. Dr. Williams founded the Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC) in 1974 to address the misperception about, and the misdiagnosis and maltreatment of African American patients. He emphasized the importance of diversity and the non-biased approach to the treatment of all communities. This literary review further explores current racial disparities African Americans face during the COVID-19 pandemic. Granted that Dr. Williams' win is a step towards progress and change, there is much to be done to conquer the cultural divide in healthcare."
"Despite a steady improvement in breast cancer survival rates over the past several decades, mortality disparities remain among Black women, who have a 42% higher death rate compared to non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Hereditary breast cancer (HBC) accounts for 5-10% of all breast cancer cases, the majority of which are due to the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> (<i>BRCA</i>) genes. Despite the availability of <i>BRCA</i> testing for over 25 years, there remain disproportionately lower rates of genetic testing among Blacks compared to NHW due to a multitude of factors. The intent of this review is to discuss racial disparities focused on HBC across diverse populations and review the existing gaps to be addressed when delivering gene-based care.','The factors contributing to the racial survival disparity are undoubtedly complex and likely an interplay between tumor biology, genomics, patterns of care and socioeconomic factors. Advances in genomic technologies that now allow for full characterization of germline DNA sequencing are integral in defining the complex and multifactorial cause of breast cancer and may help to explain the existing racial survival disparities.','Identification of inherited cancer risk may lead to cancer prevention, early cancer detection, treatment guidance, and ultimately has great potential to improve outcomes. Consequently, advances in HBC diagnosis and treatment without widespread implementation have the potential to further widen the existing breast cancer mortality gap between Black and NHW women."
"Racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination rates for seasonal influenza exist. Whether such disparities extend to patients with ESKD, who simultaneously are at risk for complications of infection and have extensive contact with health care providers, has not been investigated.','To determine whether the proportion of patients vaccinated at a dialysis facility differs according to the facility's racial and ethnic composition, we examined dialysis facility data reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The main outcome was the proportion of facility patients vaccinated for influenza among 6735 Medicare-certified facilities operating between 2014 and 2017.','Among dialysis facilities, the mean percentage of patients vaccinated during the influenza season was 72.1%. Facilities with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients had significantly lower vaccination percentages than less diverse facilities. The average proportion of patients vaccinated at each facility decreased significantly from 2014 to 2017 (a decrease of 1.05% vaccinated per year) and decreased significantly more so among facilities with higher minority proportions. The share of vaccinated patients in facilities in the quartile with the highest proportion of Black patients decreased 1.21% per year compared with a decrease of 0.88% per year in facilities in the quartile with the lowest proportion of Black patients. We found similar trends for Hispanic patients.','Rates of seasonal influenza vaccination are modestly but significantly lower among dialysis facilities with larger proportions of minority patients, and the gap seems to be widening over time. As wide-scale vaccination efforts grow more urgent amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, these disparities must be addressed to protect patients and communities equitably."
"Much is known about racial and ethnic disparities in receipt of opioids for pain in emergency departments. Less is known about such disparities in the evaluation and management of pain in the outpatient setting.','Using the nationally representative National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), we estimated disparities in visit time with physicians and opioid receipt in the outpatient setting. We focused on patients whose reason for visiting was abdominal pain or back pain. Our sample included 4,764 white patients, 692 black patients, and 682 Hispanic patients.','Back pain visits of Hispanic patients lasted 1.6 fewer minutes than those of white non-Hispanic patients (P = 0.04 for the difference). Black patients were 6.0% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for abdominal pain (P = 0.04 for the difference) and 7.1% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for back pain (P = 0.046 for the difference). Hispanic patients were 6.3% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for abdominal pain (P = 0.003 for the difference) and 14.8% less likely than white patients to receive opioids for back pain (P < 0.001 for the difference). Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to receive nonopioids instead of opioids for both abdominal pain and back pain. Differences in opioid receipt did not narrow during the examined time period.','Identifying causes of racial and ethnic disparities in the evaluation and treatment of pain in the outpatient setting is important to improving the health and function of patients."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a crisis that disproportionately affected populations already disadvantaged with respect to access to health care systems and adequate medical care and treatments. Understanding how and where health care disparities are most widespread is an important starting point for exploring opportunities to mitigate such disparities, especially within our patient population with liver disease. In a webinar in LiverLearning, we discussed the impact of the pandemic on the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, highlighting the disproportionate effects on infection rates and death for certain ethnic minorities, those socioeconomically disadvantaged and living in higher density areas, and those working in health care and other essential jobs. We set forth a ""call to action"" for members of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the larger community of providers of liver disease care to generate viable solutions to improve access to care and vaccination rates of our patients against COVID-19, and in general help reduce health care disparities and improve the health of disadvantaged populations within their communities. Solutions will likely involve personalized interventions and messaging for communities that honor local leaders and embrace the diverse needs and different cultural sensitivities of our unique patient populations."
"Alcohol and drug use are significant problems in the US, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities and individuals are known to be among the most affected. This study evaluates disparities in unintentional injury mortality causes since 1999.','Analyses in 2020 of unintentional injury mortality rate disparities between AI/ANs and white population over the 1999-2016 period with attention to motor vehicle crashes, alcohol poisoning, drug poisoning and all other cause types. Rates in each of the 10 states with the largest AI/AN populations were also investigated to account for geographical concentration.','Motor vehicle mortality rates declined for both AI/AN and white groups, but a large racial disparity was maintained. Conversely, poisoning mortality rates rose substantially in both groups, with a jump in rates in 2007 due to a coding change, resulting in a large disparity that was maintained through 2016. Comparison of alcohol and drug poisonings showed that the AI/AN alcohol poisoning rate was about eight times the white rate, whereas drug poisoning rates were similar. For 'all other' unintentional injuries, the highest rates were seen for AI/AN men, with rates generally rising over the study period. State-specific analyses found substantial variation in AI/AN rates, with few or no disparities in New York and Texas.','Results indicate substantial and persisting disparities in unintentional injury mortality, with especially large differences in alcohol poisoning. The absence of disparities in New York and Texas suggest the importance of situational factors."
"Socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular health among adults have been documented, but disparities during adolescence are less understood. In this study, we examined secular trends in cardiovascular risk factors and disparities among US adolescents.','We analyzed NHANES data from 1999 to 2014, including 11 557 (4854 fasting) participants aged 12 to 19 years. To examine trends in cardiovascular risk factors, adolescents were stratified into 3 groups on the basis of family poverty-income ratio: low income (poverty-income ratio, <1.3), middle income (≥1.3 and <3.5), and high income (≥3.5).','From 1999 to 2014, the prevalence of obesity increased (16.3%-20.9%, <i>P</i> = .001) but only among low- and middle-income adolescents, with significant disparities in prevalence by income (21.6% vs 14.6% among low- versus high-income adolescents, respectively, in 2011-2014). In addition, there were significant and persistent disparities in the prevalence of smoking (20.7% vs 7.3% among low- versus high-income adolescents, respectively, in 2011-2014), low-quality diet (68.9% vs 55.4%), and physical inactivity (25.6% vs 17.0%). No significant disparities were observed in the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia, although the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes nearly doubled (11.9%-23.1%, <i>P</i> < .001) among all adolescents from 1999 to 2014. Overall, the prevalence of adolescents with 2 or more risk factors declined, but this decline was only significant for high-income adolescents (44.1%-29.1%, <i>P</i> = .02).','Recent improvements in cardiovascular health have not been equally shared by US adolescents of varying socioeconomic status."
"The value of disaggregating non-metropolitan and metropolitan area deaths in illustrating place-based health effects is evident. However, how place interacts with characteristics such as race/ethnicity has been less firmly established. This study compared socioeconomic characteristics and age-adjusted mortality rates by race/ethnicity in six rurality designations and assessed the contributions of mortality rate disparities between non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) in each designation to national disparities. Compared to NHWs, age-adjusted mortality rates for: (1) NHBs were higher for all causes (combined), heart disease, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular disease; (2) American Indian and Alaska Natives were significantly higher for all causes in rural areas; (3) Asian Pacific islanders and Hispanics were either lower or not significantly different in all areas for all causes combined and all leading causes of death examined. The largest contribution to the U.S. disparity in mortality rates between NHBs and NHWs originated from large central metropolitan areas. Place-based variations in mortality rates and disparities may reflect resource, and access inequities that are often greater and have greater health consequences for some racial/ethnic populations than others. Tailored, systems level actions may help eliminate mortality disparities existing at intersections between race/ethnicity and place."
"Health disparities are preventable differences in the incidence, prevalence and burden of disease among communities targeted by gender, geographic location, ethnicity and/or socio-economic status. While biomedical research has identified partial origin(s) of divergent burden and impact of disease, the innovation needed to eradicate health disparities in the United States requires unique engagement from biomedical engineers. Increasing awareness of the prevalence and consequences of health disparities is particularly attractive to today's undergraduates, who have undauntedly challenged paradigms believed to foster inequality. Here, the Department of Biomedical Engineering at The City College of New York (CCNY) has leveraged its historical mission of access-and-excellence to integrate the study of health disparities into undergraduate BME curricula. This article describes our novel approach in a multiyear study that: (i) Integrated health disparities modules at all levels of the required undergraduate BME curriculum; (ii) Developed opportunities to include impacts of health disparities into undergraduate BME research projects and mentored High School summer STEM training; and (iii) Established health disparities-based challenges as BME capstone design and/or independent entrepreneurship projects. Results illustrate the rising awareness of health disparities among the youngest BMEs-to-be, as well as abundant undergraduate desire to integrate health disparities within BME education and training."
"<b>Background and Objectives:</b> In December 2014, the Kidney Allocation System (KAS) was implemented to improve equity in access to transplantation, but preliminary studies in children show mixed results. Thus, we aimed to assess how the 2014 KAS policy change affected racial/ethnic disparities in pediatric kidney transplantation access and related outcomes. <b>Design, setting, participants, and measurements:</b> A retrospective cohort study of children <18 years of age active on the kidney transplant list from 2008 to 2019 using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Log-logistic accelerated failure time models were used to determine time from first activation on the transplant list and time on dialysis to deceased-donor transplant, each with KAS era or race/ethnicity as the exposure of interest. We used logistic regression to assess odds of delayed graft function. Log-rank tests assessed time to graft loss within racial/ethnic groups across KAS eras. <b>Results:</b> All children experienced longer wait times from activation to transplantation post-KAS. In univariable analysis, Black or Hispanic children or other children of color experienced longer times from activation to transplant compared to White children in the both eras; this finding was largely attenuated after multivariable analysis (time ratio 1.16, (95% CI 1.01-1.32); 1.13 (1.00-1.28); 1.17 (0.96-1.41) post-KAS, respectively). Multivariable analysis also showed that racial/ethnic disparities in time from dialysis initiation to transplantation in the pre-KAS era was mitigated in the post-KAS era. There were no disparities in odds of delayed graft function. Black or Hispanic children experienced longer times with a functioning graft in the post-KAS era. <b>Conclusions:</b> No racial/ethnic disparities from activation to deceased donor transplantation were seen before or after implementation of KAS in multivariable analysis, while time on dialysis to transplantation and odds of short-term graft loss improved in equity after KAS, without compromising disparities in delayed graft function."
"Skilled antenatal care (ANC) has been identified as a proven intervention to reducing maternal deaths. Despite improvements in maternal health outcomes globally, some countries are signaling increased disparities in ANC services among disadvantaged sub-groups. Mauritania is one of sub-Saharan countries in Africa with a high maternal mortality ratio. Little is known about the inequalities in the country's antenatal care services. This study examined both the magnitude and change from 2011 to 2015 in socioeconomic and geographic-related disparities in the utilization of at least four antenatal care visits in Mauritania.','Using the World Health Organization's Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the 2011 and 2015 Mauritania Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) were analyzed. The inequality analysis consisted of disaggregated rates of antenatal care utilization using four equity stratifiers (economic status, education, residence, and region) and four summary measures (Difference, Population attributable risk, Ratio and Population attributable fraction). A 95% Uncertainty Interval was constructed around point estimates to measure statistical significance.','Substantial absolute and relative socioeconomic and geographic related disparities in attending four or more ANC visits (ANC4+ utilization) were observed favoring women who were richest/rich (PAR = 19.5, 95% UI; 16.53, 22.43), educated (PAF = 7.3 95% UI; 3.34, 11.26), urban residents (D = 19, 95% UI; 14.50, 23.51) and those living in regions such as Nouakchott (R = 2.1, 95% UI; 1.59, 2.56). While education-related disparities decreased, wealth-driven and regional disparities remained constant over the 4 years of the study period. Urban-rural inequalities were constant except with the PAR measure, which showed an increasing pattern.','A disproportionately lower ANC4+ utilization was observed among women who were poor, uneducated, living in rural areas and regions such as Guidimagha. As a result, policymakers need to design interventions that will enable disadvantaged subpopulations to benefit from ANC4+ utilization to meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to 140/100, 000 live births by 2030."
"The federal government uses multiple definitions for identifying rural communities based on various geographies and different elements of rurality.','The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess the degree to which rural definitions identify the same areas as rural; and (2) assess rural-urban disparities identified by each definition across socioeconomic, demographic, and health access and outcome measures.','We determined the rural status of each census tract and calculated the rural-urban disparity resulting from each definition, as well as across the number of definitions in which tracts were designated as rural (rurality agreement).','The population in 72,506 census tracts.','We used 8 federal rural definitions. Population characteristics included percent with a bachelor's degree, income below 200% poverty, population density, percent with health insurance and whether various health care services were within 30 minutes driving time of the tract centroid.','The rural population varied from slightly < 6.9 million people to >75.5 million across definitions. The largest rural-urban disparities were found using Urban Influence Codes. Urbanized Area and Urbanized Cluster tended to generate smaller disparities. Population characteristics such as population density and percent White had notable discontinuities across levels of rurality, while others such as percent with a bachelor's degree and income below 200% poverty varied continuously.','Rural-urban populations and disparities were sensitive to the specific definition and the relative strength of definitions varied across population characteristics. Researchers and policymakers should carefully consider the choice of outcome and region when deciding the most appropriate rural definition."
"Cardiothoracic transplantation is the definitive therapy for end-stage heart and lung disease. In service to this population, disparities in access and care must be simultaneously understood and addressed.','There are sex, race, geographic, age, and underlying disease disparities in both heart and lung transplantation. Women have reduced waitlist survival but improved posttransplant survival when compared with men for both heart and lung transplantation. Black patients have worse outcome compared with other races postheart transplant. Geographic disparities impact the likelihood of receiving heart or lung transplant and the growing number of patients with advanced age seeking transplant complicates discussions on survival benefit. Finally, underlying disease has affected outcomes for both heart and lung transplant and now are incorporated into the allocation system.','Though heart and lung transplantation have several existing disparities, it remains to be seen how advancements in medical technology, changes in donor organ allocation policies, and growing experience in patient selection will impact these concerns."
"Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are disproportionately affected by diabetes. We assessed the state of racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes quality of care in the USA.','We analyzed cross-sectional data of adults diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in the nationally representative 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Differences in adherence to five diabetes quality of care recommendations (HbA1c twice yearly, yearly foot exam, dilated eye exam, blood cholesterol test, and flu vaccination) were examined by race/ethnicity while controlling for three social determinants of health (health insurance status, poverty, and education) and other demographic variables.','Among adults with diabetes in the USA, 74.9% received two or more HbA1c tests, 69.0% had a foot exam, 64.9% had an eye exam, 85.4% had a cholesterol test, and 65.1% received flu vaccination in 2013. Compared to Whites, all were lower for Hispanics; HbA1c tests, eye exam, and flu vaccination were lower for Blacks; HbA1c tests, foot exam, and eye exam were lower for Asians. In adjusted models, the only remaining disparities in quality of care indicators were HbA1c tests for Hispanics (AOR 0.67, CI = 0.47-0.97), Blacks (AOR 0.59, CI = 0.40-0.88), and Asians (AOR 0.47, CI = 0.42-0.99); foot exams for Hispanics (AOR 0.65, CI = 0.47-0.90); and flu vaccination for Blacks (AOR 0.68, CI = 0.49-0.93).','Lack of insurance coverage and education explained some of the racial/ethnic disparities observed in diabetes quality of care. Improving quality of diabetes care could help reduce rates of diabetes complications, healthcare costs, and mortality."
"Health disparities in diabetes management and control are well-documented. The objective of this study is to describe one diabetes education program delivered in the United States in terms of the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) Planning and Evaluation Framework. Questionnaires, clinical data, and administrative records were analyzed from 8664 adults with diabetes living in South Texas, an area characterized by high health disparities. The Diabetes Education Program delivered was a professionally led 12-month program involving 8 h of in-person workshop education followed by quarterly follow-up sessions. Changes in average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months (e.g., A1c levels) were the primary clinical outcome. Descriptive and multiple generalized linear mixed models were performed. This community-based initiative reached a large and diverse population, and statistically significant reductions in A1c levels (<i>p</i> < 0.01) were observed among participants with Type 2 diabetes at 3 months. These reductions in A1c levels were sustained at 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up assessments (<i>p</i> < 0.01). However, considerable attrition over time at follow-up sessions indicate the need for more robust strategies to keep participants engaged. For this diabetes education program, the RE-AIM model was a useful framework to present study processes and outcomes."
"Latinx is the largest minority population group in the United States and disproportionately affected by health disparities. Efforts to address such health disparities require a concerted, multipronged approach that should involve training the next generation of Latinx health professionals to become part of a culturally competent workforce. This article describes a formative assessment of a faculty mentored undergraduate research program at the University Massachusetts-Boston, called ""<i>Avancemos!</i>: Advancing Research Skills and Professional Career Opportunities in Health Sciences for Latinx Undergraduate Students"" designed to provide mentorship, research training, and professional career development skills for undergraduate Latinx students. We employed a mixed-method approach in the formative assessment of the program. Our results showed that over the course of four academic semesters the program served a majority female, first-generation, immigrant low-income Latinx undergraduate students. Our qualitative assessment of students' perceived benefits of participation in the program suggests positive effects on a number of areas including the acquisition of concrete and marketable research skills, enhanced understanding and application of knowledge gained in other courses, increased network, enhanced sense of belonging to the academic community, increased professional self-confidence, and enhanced preparedness and plans to pursue graduate studies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that participation in community-engaged research activities offered opportunities for students to realize the role research plays in reducing health disparities. Faculty-mentored undergraduate research programs such as the <i>Avancemos!</i> offer essential opportunities to build partnerships between academia and underserved Latinx communities to address health disparities, while contributing to the development of culturally competent health professions workforce."
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the importance of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in preventing death from the severe respiratory illness associated with COVID-19. However, the availability of ICU beds is highly variable across the US, and health care resources are generally more plentiful in wealthier communities. We examined disparities in community ICU beds by US communities' median household income. We found a large gap in access by income: 49 percent of the lowest-income communities had no ICU beds in their communities, whereas only 3 percent of the highest-income communities had no ICU beds. Income disparities in the availability of community ICU beds were more acute in rural areas than in urban areas. Policies that facilitate hospital coordination are urgently needed to address shortages in ICU hospital bed supply to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality rates in low-income communities."
"To compare the distribution of malnutrition by socio-economic indicators (SEI) in Peruvian children under 5 years and women of reproductive age (WRA).','We analysed data from the National Demographic and Family Health Survey. WHO criteria were used to define malnutrition indicators (overweight/obesity combined (OW); wasting/underweight; stunting/short stature; anaemia). Linear combination test was used to compare the prevalence of malnutrition by SEI (wealth index as a proxy of socio-economic status (SES); education; ethnicity). Prevalence ratio (PR) was used to describe disparities and associations between malnutrition and SEI.','Peru (2015).','Children (n 22 833) under 5 years and WRA (n 33 503; 5008 adolescents and 28 495 adults).','The most prevalent form of malnutrition was anaemia (32·0 %) in children and OW in adolescent and adult WRA (31·3 and 65·1 %, respectively). Adjusted models showed that stunting and anaemia were significantly lower among children with high SES (PR = 0·25, 0·67), high-educated mothers (PR = 0·26, 0·76) and higher in indigenous children (PR = 1·3, 1·2); conversely, OW was higher among those with high SES and high-educated mothers (PR = 1·8, 1·6) compared with their lowest counterparts. In WRA, stunting/short stature was lower among those with high SES, high education and higher in indigenous adult women. OW in adolescents and adults was higher in high SES (PR = 1·4, 1·1), lower in indigenous adult women (PR = 0·84) and lower in high-educated adult women (PR = 0·86).','In the studied population, the distribution of malnutrition was associated with SEI disparities. Effective policies that integrate actions to overcome the double burden of malnutrition and reduce disparities are needed."
"We estimate life expectancy with and without dementia for Americans 65 years and older by education and race to examine how these stratification systems combine to shape disparities in later-life cognitive health.','Based on the Health and Retirement Study (2000-2014), we use a multivariate, incidence-based life table approach to estimate life expectancy by cognitive health status for race-education groups. The models also simulate group differences in the prevalence of dementia implied by these rates.','The life table results document notable race-education differences in dementia and dementia-free life expectancy, as well as stark differences in implied dementia prevalence. At each education level, blacks can expect to live more years with dementia and they have significantly higher rates of dementia prevalence. This distribution of disparities in the older population is anchored by 2 groups-blacks without a high school diploma and whites with some college or more.','Dementia experience and dementia burden differ dramatically along race-education lines. Race and education combine to exaggerate disparities and they both have enduring effects. Future research should explicitly consider how race and education combine to influence dementia in the older American population."
"Although sexual orientation-related alcohol use disparities are well established, researchers have not identified whether disparities are diminishing as societal attitudes towards lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) people become more accepting. We examined changes in four alcohol-related disparities between heterosexual and LGB youth from 1998 to 2013 by (1) estimating the prevalence of these behaviors; (2) estimating disparities in alcohol-related outcomes between heterosexual and LGB youth within each wave year; and (3) testing whether the degree of difference in alcohol-related disparities between heterosexual and LGB youth has changed.','Logistic regression models and year × sexual orientation interactions with repeated, cross-sectional, provincially representative data.','British Columbia, Canada.','Students (ages 12-19) from the 1998 (n = 22 858), 2003 (n = 29 323), 2008 (n = 25 254) and 2013 (n = 21 938) British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (total n = 99 373, 48.7% male, mean age = 14.84).','We modeled age-adjusted differences in life-time alcohol use, age of onset, past 30-day drinking and past 30-day heavy episodic drinking between heterosexual and three subgroups of sexual minority youth (i.e. mostly heterosexual, bisexual and lesbian/gay).','Generally, alcohol use declined for all youth, although less so among LGB youth [average adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.58 and aOR = 0.53 for heterosexual males and females and aOR = 0.71 and aOR = 0.57 for sexual minority males and females, respectively). Within-year comparisons demonstrated elevated rates of alcohol use among LGB compared with heterosexual youth for each of the four survey years, especially among females. Findings indicate few changes over time; however, results show an increase in risky alcohol use from 1998 to 2013 among mostly heterosexual (aOR = 1.58 for life-time alcohol use, aOR = 1.58 for 30-day alcohol use and aOR = 1.34 for 30-day heavy episodic drinking), and bisexual (aOR = 1.95 for life-time alcohol use) females.','Despite the general decline in the prevalence of alcohol use among young people in Canada since 1998, lesbian/gay and bisexual youth in Canada continue to show elevated rates of alcohol use compared with heterosexual youth."
"Diabetes is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, and its precursor, pre-diabetes, is estimated to occur in one-third of American adults. Understanding the geographic disparities in the distribution of these conditions and identifying high-prevalence areas is critical to guiding control and prevention programs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate clusters of pre-diabetes and diabetes risk in Florida and identify significant predictors of the conditions.','Data from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were obtained from the Florida Department of Health. Spatial scan statistics were used to identify and locate significant high-prevalence local clusters. The county prevalence proportions of pre-diabetes and diabetes and the identified significant clusters were displayed in maps. Logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors of the two conditions for individuals living within and outside high-prevalence clusters.','The study included a total of 34,186 respondents. The overall prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes were 8.2 and 11.5%, respectively. Three significant (p < 0.05) local, high-prevalence spatial clusters were detected for pre-diabetes, while five were detected for diabetes. The counties within the high-prevalence clusters had prevalence ratios ranging from 1.29 to 1.85. There were differences in the predictors of the conditions based on whether respondents lived within or outside high-prevalence clusters. Predictors of both pre-diabetes and diabetes regardless of region or place of residence were obesity/overweight, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Income and physical activity level were significant predictors of diabetes but not pre-diabetes. Arthritis, sex, and marital status were significant predictors of diabetes only among residents of high-prevalence clusters, while educational attainment and smoking were significant predictors of diabetes only among residents of non-cluster counties.','Geographic disparities of pre-diabetes and diabetes exist in Florida. Information from this study is useful for guiding resource allocation and targeting of intervention programs focusing on identified modifiable predictors of pre-diabetes and diabetes so as to reduce health disparities and improve the health of all Floridians."
"We aimed to identify differences in disparities among patients with a cancer in which screening is widely recommended (colorectal cancer [CRC]) and one in which it is not (esophageal cancer).','A retrospective analysis was performed using 2004-2015 data from the National Cancer Database. Multivariable generalized logistic regression was used to identify potential differences in the effect of disparities in stage at diagnosis.','A total of 96,524 esophageal cancer patients and 361,187 CRC patients were included. Black patients, longer travel distances, and lower educational attainment were only associated with increased odds of stage IV CRC. While both Medicaid and uninsured patients were more likely to be diagnosed with stage IV esophageal and CRC, the effect was larger among CRC patients. From 2004 to 2015, the rates of stage IV esophageal cancer decreased from 42.0% to 38.2%, while the rates of stage IV CRC increased from 36.9% to 40.8% (p < 0.0001).','Disparities are more pronounced in CRC, compared to esophageal cancer. Equity in access to screening and cancer care should be prioritized."
"<b>Objective:</b> The objectives of this study were (a) to assess the nature and extent of racial disparities in cognitive functioning among older adults in Canada, and (b) to assess the role of socioeconomic factors and patterned health behaviors as social determinants of racial disparities in cognitive functioning. <b>Method:</b> Data were drawn from the 2009-2010 Canadian Community Health Survey. The study sample included 20,646 people aged 60 years or older. Ordered logistic regression analyses were carried out to test hypotheses linking race, socioeconomic factors, and patterned health behaviors, and cognitive functioning. <b>Results:</b> Our findings revealed a racial gap in cognitive functioning among older adults in Canada. This gap was, in part, mediated by socioeconomic inequalities (in income and food security) and socially patterned behaviors (i.e., drinking, physical activity levels). However, socioeconomic status (SES) and behavioral factors appeared to operate independently of one another. <b>Discussion:</b> The findings suggest a need to focus on the direct effects of race as well as its indirect effects, through socioeconomic factors and patterned health behaviors, for an understanding of racial disparities in cognitive functioning."
"<b>Objective:</b> This study examines whether disparities exist in poor health and depressive symptomatology among older gay/bisexual men (50+) with (<i>n</i> = 371) and without (<i>n</i> = 973) HIV. If so, what risk/promoting factors account for those disparities? <b>Method:</b> These cross-sectional analyses used 2014 data from the Aging With Pride: National Health, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study. <b>Results:</b> Those with HIV reported poorer health and more depressive symptomatology accounted for by lower income, resilience and social support, and more lifetime victimization. Poorer health among those with HIV was associated with more chronic conditions. Higher depressive symptomatology was associated with diagnosed anxiety and drug addiction. Community engagement reduced disparities in poor health and depression. <b>Implications:</b> Older gay/bisexual men living with HIV infection are at greater risk for physical and mental health issues. Assessments should be conducted with attention to these risk factors. Interventions for improving social support, resilience, and community engagement are warranted."
"Substantial research has documented inequalities between US minorities and whites in meeting the eligibility criteria for the Medicare Part D medication therapy management (MTM) program. Even though the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services attempted to relax the eligibility criteria, a critical barrier to effective MTM reform is a lack of stronger evidence about the effects of MTM on minorities' health outcomes.','To examine the effects of comprehensive medication review (CMR), an MTM core component, on racial and ethnic disparities in adherence to diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia medications among Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years.','This study used full-year 2017 Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims data, including MTM data, linked to the Area Health Resources Files. Racial and ethnic disparities in nonadherence to diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia medications were compared between CMR recipients and nonrecipients matched by their propensity scores. To determine the changes in racial and ethnic disparities after receiving CMR, a difference-in-differences framework was applied, by including in logistic regression analyses interaction terms between dummy variables for CMR receipt and each racial or ethnic minority group.','Compared with CMR nonrecipients, CMR recipients had significantly lower racial and ethnic disparities across the 3 outcome measures, with the exception of the difference between whites and blacks in nonadherence to diabetes medications. For example, compared with CMR nonrecipients, among CMR recipients the differences in the odds of nonadherence to hypertension medications were reduced, respectively, by 8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.96) between whites and blacks; by 18% (95% CI, 0.78-0.86) between whites and Hispanics; by 16% (95% CI, 0.77-0.91) between whites and Asians; and by 9% (95% CI, 0.85-0.98) between whites and other racial and ethnic groups.','Receiving a CMR reduced the racial and ethnic disparities in adherence to diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia medications among Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years. These findings provide critical empirical evidence that may inform the future design of the Medicare Part D MTM program, which is valuable for improving pharmacotherapy outcomes and could further realize its potential when additional people from racial and ethnic minorities are enrolled."
"Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (1-3). Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian populations vary in language; cultural practices; and social, economic, and environmental experiences,<sup>†</sup> which can affect health outcomes (4).<sup>§</sup> However, data from these populations are often aggregated in analyses. Although data aggregation is often used as an approach to increase sample size and statistical power when analyzing data from smaller population groups, it can limit the understanding of disparities among diverse Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian subpopulations<sup>¶</sup> (4-7). To assess disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian populations, a disaggregated, descriptive analysis, informed by recommendations from these communities,** was performed using race data from 21,005 COVID-19 cases and 449 COVID-19-associated deaths reported to the Hawaii State Department of Health (HDOH) during March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021.<sup>††</sup> In Hawaii, COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 population were 1,477 and 32, respectively during this period. In analyses with race categories that were not mutually exclusive, including persons of one race alone or in combination with one or more races, Pacific Islander persons, who account for 5% of Hawaii's population, represented 22% of COVID-19 cases and deaths (COVID-19 incidence of 7,070 and mortality rate of 150). Native Hawaiian persons experienced an incidence of 1,181 and a mortality rate of 15. Among subcategories of Asian populations, the highest incidences were experienced by Filipino persons (1,247) and Vietnamese persons (1,200). Disaggregating Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian race data can aid in identifying racial disparities among specific subpopulations and highlights the importance of partnering with communities to develop culturally responsive outreach teams<sup>§§</sup> and tailored public health interventions and vaccination campaigns to more effectively address health disparities."
"This review highlights obesity-related disparities among Latino children and adolescents, discusses the social determinants of health (SDoH) that drive disparities, and presents case studies of strategies for reducing disparities and promoting health equity.','Recommended strategies for reducing obesity-related disparities include the use of culturally grounded programming, multi-sector collaborations, and technology. We present two exemplar studies that demonstrate that integrating cultural values and enhancing the overall cultural fit of prevention programs can increase engagement among high-risk Latino families. We also examine the use of multi-sector collaborations to build community capacity and address key SDoH that impact health behaviors and outcomes. Our last example study demonstrates the utility of technology for engaging youth and extending the reach of prevention strategies in vulnerable communities. To address growing obesity-related disparities, there is an urgent need to develop and test these strategies among high-risk, vulnerable populations like Latino children and adolescents."
"Epilepsy is a leading cause of global disease burden, with people with epilepsy (PWE) experiencing adverse health outcomes related to the psychiatric comorbidities and socioeconomic consequences of the disorder. Rural populations are more likely to be impoverished or uninsured, which could impact health outcomes for rural-dwelling PWE (RPWE).','This systematic literature review identified original research studying health disparities and outcomes among RPWE in the United States and Canada to (1) characterize the disparities faced by RPWE and (2) elucidate the effects of these disparities upon clinical outcomes.','We performed a systematic search of six electronic databases: Pubmed, Cochrane, PsychInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid. Articles considered were original research reports conducted in Canada or the United States before August 2020. A modified Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies.','Our search returned 2093 articles that examined the health disparities of RPWE, of which six met criteria for this review. Outcome measures of health disparity included in these papers were mortality (2; 33%), use of health resources (2; 33%), and epilepsy prevalence (2; 33%). Only one paper (16%) concluded that RPWE experienced worse health outcomes relative to urban-dwelling PWE, while 5 (84%) found no difference.','Our study did not find sufficient evidence that RPWE in the US and Canada experience significant health disparities compared to similar urban populations of PWE. More research using prospective studies and datasets allowing better characterization of rurality is required."
"Precision medicine has uncertain potential to address population health disparities.','Case study of disparities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).','Literature-based evaluation of ALL in African American (AA) and European American (EA) children.','AA children have a lower incidence of ALL than EA children, experience higher relapse rates, and are more likely to be diagnosed with poor prognostic indicators. Environmental risk exposures for ALL have small effect sizes; data are insufficient to determine their contribution to differences in incidence and prognosis. Differences in prevalence of gene variants associated with treatment response contribute to higher relapse rates in AA children. However, higher relapse rates were not seen in a care setting that eliminated out of pocket costs, used risk-directed therapy, and included rigorous case management.','Unequal access to effective treatment contributes to ALL disparities. Precision medicine can help to define effective treatment for diverse patient populations."
"Ovarian cancer (OC) is a serious condition that often presents at advanced stages and has high mortality rates, with the current mode of early-stage screening lacking sensitivity and specificity. OC often presents asymptomatically, which renders early diagnosis difficult. Furthermore, many patients lack significant risk factors or family history of the disease. Five-year survival rates differ between patients with OC among racial, ethnic, and social groups as a result of different social barriers. This review article aims to present the currently existing data regarding health care disparities among OC patients of different ethnic, demographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and what next steps should be taken to better understand and eventually eliminate these potentially devastating health care disparities. Increasing data support the notion that a combination of genomic, socioeconomic status, social factors, and cultural differences lead to differential treatments and therefore health care disparities. While genomic and biological factors are important, language barriers, geographic and travel barriers, differences in comorbidity likelihood between populations, and different treatment plans seem to have a greater impact on 5-year survival rates of patients from diverse backgrounds. Language barriers limit a shared-decision model of care. Transportation limitations and geographic differences can lead to limited follow-up and insufficient care in resource and equipment restrictive settings. Patients with these barriers also tend to have a higher incidence of comorbidities that raise the mortality rate of OC. Further research needs to explore effective solutions to bridge health care disparities and understand why they occur."
"Multilevel interventions can be uniquely effective at addressing minority health and health disparities, but they pose substantial methodological, data analytic, and assessment challenges that must be considered when designing and applying interventions and assessment. To facilitate the adoption of multilevel interventions to reduce health disparities, we outline areas of need in filling existing operational challenges to the design and assessment of multilevel interventions. We discuss areas of development that address overarching constructs inherent in multilevel interventions, with a particular focus on their application to minority health and health disparities. Our approach will prove useful to researchers, as it allows them to integrate information related to health disparities research into the framework of broader constructs with which they are familiar. We urge researchers to prioritize building transdisciplinary teams and the skills needed to overcome the challenges in designing and assessing multilevel interventions, as even small contributions can accelerate progress toward improving minority health and reducing health disparities. To make substantial progress, however, a concerted and strategic effort, including work to advance analytic techniques and measures, is needed."
"To assess a quality improvement initiative designed to highlight awareness of health disparities and improve healthcare practices among participants.','Data were collected from 102 clinically practicing PAs over a 2-year timespan via the quality improvement initiative Outside the Box: Reducing Health Disparities. As part of the program, participants reviewed 10 random charts in their practice, documenting how they identified and/or managed common health disparities. Then, participants reviewed the educational materials provided and implemented practice-specific interventions. Thirty days after the initial review, a second random review of charts was executed.','Postintervention results showed statistically significant moderate- to large-sized quality improvement across most categories.','This study demonstrates that Outside the Box participation was associated with practice quality improvements among participants in several domains that are known to experience health disparities. Results suggest that increasing awareness of ideal professional behaviors can result in quality improvements in practices."
"The National Collaborative for Improving the Clinical Learning Environment offers guidance to health care leaders for engaging new clinicians in efforts to eliminate health care disparities.','To address health care disparities that are pervasive across the United States, individuals at all levels of the health care system need to commit to ensuring equity in care. Engaging new clinicians is a key element of any systems-based approach, as new clinicians will shape the future of health care delivery. Clinical learning environments, or the hospitals, medical centers, and ambulatory care clinics where new clinicians train, have an important role in this process. Efforts may include training in cultural humility and cultural competency, education about the organization's vulnerable populations, and continuous interprofessional experiential learning through comprehensive, systems-based QI efforts focused on eliminating health care disparities.','By preparing and supporting new clinicians to engage in systems-based QI efforts to eliminate health care disparities, clinical learning environments are instilling skills and supporting behaviors that clinicians can build throughout their careers-and helping pave the road towards equity throughout the US health care system."
"To describe disparities in post-operative mortality experienced by Indigenous Māori compared to non-Indigenous New Zealanders.','We completed a national study of all those undergoing a surgical procedure between 2005 and 2017 in New Zealand. We examined 30-day and 90-day post-operative mortality for all surgical specialties and by common procedures. We compared age-standardised rates between ethnic groups (Māori, Pacific, Asian, European, MELAA/Other) and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression modelling adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, rurality, comorbidity, ASA score, anaesthetic type, procedure risk and procedure specialty.','From nearly 3.9 million surgical procedures (876,976 acute, 2,990,726 elective/waiting list), we observed ethnic disparities in post-operative mortality across procedures, with the largest disparities occurring between Māori and Europeans. Māori had higher rates of 30- and 90-day post-operative mortality across most broad procedure categories, with the disparity between Māori and Europeans strongest for elective/waiting list procedures (eg, elective/waiting list musculoskeletal procedures, 30-day mortality: adj. HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.56-2.39).','The disparities we observed are likely driven by a combination of healthcare system, process and clinical team factors, and we have presented the key mechanisms within these factors."
"Health disparity populations are socially disadvantaged, and the multiple levels of discrimination they often experience mean that their characteristics and attributes differ from those of the mainstream. Programs and policies targeted at reducing health disparities or improving minority health must consider these differences. Despite the importance of evaluating health disparities research to produce high-quality data that can guide decision-making, it is not yet a customary practice. Although health disparities evaluations incorporate the same scientific methods as all evaluations, they have unique components such as population characteristics, sociocultural context, and the lack of health disparity common indicators and metrics that must be considered in every phase of the research. This article describes evaluation strategies grouped into 3 components: formative (needs assessments and process), design and methodology (multilevel designs used in real-world settings), and summative (outcomes, impacts, and cost). Each section will describe the standards for each component, discuss the unique health disparity aspects, and provide strategies from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Metrics and Measures Visioning Workshop (April 2016) to advance the evaluation of health disparities research."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted head and neck cancer (HNC) care delivery in ways that will likely persist long term. As we scan the horizon, this crisis has the potential to amplify preexisting racial/ethnic disparities for patients with HNC. Potential drivers of disparate HNC survival resulting from the pandemic include (a) differential access to telemedicine, timely diagnosis, and treatment; (b) implicit bias in initiatives to triage, prioritize, and schedule HNC-directed therapy; and (c) the marked changes in employment, health insurance, and dependent care. We present four strategies to mitigate these disparities: (a) collect detailed data on access to care by race/ethnicity, income, education, and community; (b) raise awareness of HNC disparities; (c) engage stakeholders in developing culturally appropriate solutions; and (d) ensure that surgical prioritization protocols minimize risk of racial/ethnic bias. Collectively, these measures address social determinants of health and the moral imperative to provide equitable, high-quality HNC care."
"Obesity rates have risen significantly in recent decades, with underprivileged Americans associated with higher rates of the condition. Risks associated with obesity, furthermore, appear unequally distributed across different racial/ethnic groups, according to the literature. The present study examined racial disparities in obesity as a function of socioeconomic factors, using a sample of American adults from a 32-year longitudinal study. We accounted for the time factor as we evaluated obesity's associations with selected socioeconomic factors; we also examined race/ethnicity's moderating role in obesity-socioeconomic status associations over time. We used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to obtain a final sample of 118,749 person-waves for analysis. A subsample of person-waves numbering 65,702 represented data from White respondents; one numbering 31,618 represented data from Black respondents; and one numbering 21,429 represented data from Hispanic respondents. Needing to consider repeated measures of the same variables over time, we chose generalized estimated equations (GEE) for use in the data analysis. Speaking generally, the obtained results suggested that for the two smaller subsamples, minority race/ethnicity could have introduced disadvantages that helped explain links between obesity and race/ethnicity. Results also showed that White-Black disparities in obesity have widened slightly in the past three decades, while White-Hispanic disparities have stabilized during the same time period."
"Suboptimal glycemic control is more common among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) and Hispanics than non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Disparities in the performance of self-care behaviors may contribute to this. To synthesize knowledge on current self-care disparities, we reviewed studies from January 2011-March 2016 that included NHWs, NHBs, and Hispanics with type 2 diabetes in the USA. Self-care behaviors included diet, exercise, medications, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), self-foot exams, and not smoking. Of 1241 articles identified in PubMed, 25 met our inclusion criteria. These studies report consistent disparities in medication adherence. Surprisingly, we found consistent evidence of no disparities in exercise and some evidence of reverse disparities: compared to NHWs, Hispanics had healthier diets and NHBs had more regular SMBG. Consistent use of validated measures could further inform disparities in diet and exercise. Additional research is needed to test for disparities in self-foot exams, not smoking, and diabetes-specific problem solving and coping."
"While the increased burden of COVID-19 among the Black population has been recognized, most attempts to quantify the extent of this racial disparity have not taken the age distribution of the population into account. In this paper, we determine the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates across 35 states using direct age standardization. We then explore the relationship between structural racism and differences in the magnitude of this disparity across states.','Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we calculated both crude and age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates for the non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations in each state. We explored the relationship between a state-level structural racism index and the observed differences in the racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across states. We explored the potential mediating effects of disparities in exposure based on occupation, underlying medical conditions, and health care access.','Relying upon crude death rate ratios resulted in a substantial underestimation of the true magnitude of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates. The structural racism index was a robust predictor of the observed racial disparities. Each standard deviation increase in the racism index was associated with an increase of 0.26 in the ratio of COVID-19 mortality rates among the Black compared to the White population.','Structural racism should be considered a root cause of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality. Dismantling the long-standing systems of racial oppression is critical to adequately address both the downstream and upstream causes of racial inequities in the disease burden of COVID-19."
"The role of engineers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in the elimination of health disparities, while not always visible, has important implications for the attainment of impactful solutions. The design skills, systems approach, and innovative mindset that engineers bring all have the potential to combat crises in novel and impactful ways. When a disparities lens is applied, a lens that views gaps in access, resources, and care, the engineering solutions are bound to be more robust and equitable. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the Black community and other communities of color is linked to inequities in health rooted in a centuries long structural racism. Engineers working collaboratively with physicians and healthcare providers are poised to close equity gaps and strengthen the collective response to COVID-19 and future pandemics."
"Racial/ethnic disparities in maternal care exist, even as medicine continues to progress on several aspects, medical care continues to fail countless women each year, particularly minority women and women of color. Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women experienced exponentially more pregnancy-related deaths. Recognizing factors that underlie disparities in pregnancy-related deaths and implementing preventive approaches to resolve them may mitigate racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related mortality. Future research on these disparities should focus on strategies for reducing racial/ethnic inequalities in pregnancy-related deaths, including improving access to high-quality preconception, maternity, and postpartum care for minority women, multi-ethnic education for physicians and healthcare providers in a bid to eliminate implicit biases, adequate funding, and improvement of healthcare facilities in minority areas, education of healthcare providers on variation in the incidence of some certain conditions in different ethnic groups so that care is patient-centered and culturally appropriate. All of these can be enforced through the community, healthcare facility, patient, family, physician, and system-level collaboration."
"Although research shows that public health is substantially affected during and after disasters, few studies have examined the health effects of Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on the Texas coast in August 2017. We assessed disparities in physical health, mental health, and health care access after Hurricane Harvey among residents of the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas, metropolitan statistical area (ie, Houston MSA).','We used structured survey data collected through telephone and online surveys from a population-based random sample of Houston MSA residents (n = 403) collected from November 29, 2017, through January 6, 2018. We used descriptive statistics to describe the prevalence of physical health/mental health and health care access outcomes and multivariable generalized linear models to assess disparities (eg, based on race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability) in health outcomes.','Physical health problems disproportionately affected persons who did not evacuate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.87). Non-Hispanic black persons were more likely than non-Hispanic white persons to have posttraumatic stress (OR = 5.03; 95% CI, 1.90-13.10), as were persons in households that experienced job loss post-Harvey (vs did not experience job loss post-Harvey; OR = 2.89; 95% CI, 1.14-7.32) and older persons (OR = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06). Health care access was constrained for persons whose households lost jobs post-Harvey (vs did not lose jobs post-Harvey; OR = 2.73; 95% CI, 1.29-5.78) and for persons with disabilities (vs without disabilities; OR = 3.19; 95% CI, 1.37-7.45).','Our findings underscore the need to plan for and ameliorate public health disparities resulting from climate change-related disasters, which are expected to occur with increased frequency and magnitude."
"Pertussis is a toxin-mediated respiratory illness caused by <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> that can result in severe complications and death, particularly in infants. Between 2008 and 2011, children less than 3 months old accounted for 83% of the pertussis deaths in the United States. Understanding the geographic disparities in the distribution of pertussis risk and identifying high risk geographic areas is necessary for guiding resource allocation and public health control strategies. Therefore, this study investigated geographic disparities and temporal changes in pertussis risk in Florida from 2010 to 2018. It also investigated socioeconomic and demographic predictors of the identified disparities.','Pertussis data covering the time period 2010-2018 were obtained from Florida HealthCHARTS web interface. Spatial patterns and temporal changes in geographic distribution of pertussis risk were assessed using county-level choropleth maps for the time periods 2010-2012, 2013-2015, 2016-2018 and 2010-2018. Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics were used to identify high-risk spatial clusters which were displayed in maps. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to identify significant predictors of county-level risk. Residuals of the OLS model were assessed for model assumptions including spatial autocorrelation.','County-level pertussis risk varied from 0 to 116.31 cases per 100,000 people during the study period. A total of 11 significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) spatial clusters were identified with risk ratios ranging from 1.5 to 5.8. Geographic distribution remained relatively consistent over time with areas of high risk persisting in the western panhandle, northeastern coast, and along the western coast. Although county level pertussis risks generally increased from 2010-2012 to 2013-2015, risk tended to be lower during the 2016-2018 time period. Significant predictors of county-level pertussis risk were rurality, percentage of females, and median income. Counties with high pertussis risk tended to be rural (<i>p</i> = 0.021), those with high median incomes (<i>p</i> = 0.039), and those with high percentages of females (<i>p</i> < 0.001).','There is evidence that geographic disparities exist and have persisted over time in Florida. This study highlights the application and importance of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and spatial statistical/epidemiological tools in identifying areas of highest disease risk so as to guide resource allocation to reduce health disparities and improve health for all."
"Currently, Black men in the United States are greater than 1.5 times as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than twice as likely to succumb to the disease. While racial disparities in prostate cancer have been well documented, we must analyze these disparities in the correct context. Discussion of these disparities without correctly describing race as a social construct and acknowledging the impact of structural racism is insufficient. This article reviews the disparities seen in screening, treatment, outcomes, and clinical trial participation. We conclude by outlining future steps to help understand and study disparities, as we strive toward equitable outcomes."
"Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are disproportionately experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and expose these groups to unnecessary iatrogenic harm (including the risk of nosocomial COVID-19) and undue financial burden. In working toward an overarching goal of eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities, it is important to understand whether and to what extent potentially avoidable hospitalizations have changed by race and ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic.','This single-center pre-post study included patients admitted to any UCLA Health hospital for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition between March-August 2019 (prepandemic period) and March-August 2020 (postpandemic period). Investigators measured the change in the number of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (defined per the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines) stratified by race and ethnicity and calculated the 95% CIs for these hospitalizations using a cluster bootstrap procedure.','Between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020, 347 of 4,838 hospitalizations (7.2%) were potentially avoidable, compared with 557 of 6,248 (8.9%) during the same 6-month period in 2019. Potentially avoidable hospitalizations decreased by 50.3% (95% CI=41.2, 60.9) among non-Hispanic Whites but only by 8.0% (95% CI= -16.2, 39.9) among African Americans (50.3% vs 8.0%, p=0.015).','Racial disparities in potentially avoidable hospitalizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large urban health system. Given that the prepandemic rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations were already higher among racial and ethnic minorities, especially among African Americans, this finding should cause alarm and lead to further exploration of the complex factors contributing to these disparities."
"The current study aimed to (i) describe racial/ethnic disparities in household food and beverage purchases among participants and non-participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and (ii) examine longitudinal associations between SNAP participation and purchases by race/ethnicity.','To describe disparities, we estimated sociodemographic-adjusted mean purchases of seven unhealthy food and beverage groups (e.g. junk food, sugar-sweetened beverages) and four nutrients (e.g. sugar, Na) among white, black and Hispanic SNAP-participating and non-participating households. To examine longitudinal associations, we used multivariable linear regression with household fixed effects.','USA, 2010-2014.','Food and beverage purchases among low-income (≤250 % federal poverty line) US households (n 30 403) participating in the Nielsen Homescan Panel.','Among non-participants, there were significant black-white disparities (i.e. differences favouring white households) in households' adjusted mean purchases of processed meat, sweeteners, sugar-sweetened beverages, energy and Na. These disparities persisted among SNAP participants. In contrast, the only significant Hispanic-white disparity among non-participants was for Na purchases; this disparity was reduced in magnitude and no longer significant among SNAP-participating households. Additionally, Hispanic households purchased less energy from junk foods than white households, regardless of SNAP status. In longitudinal models accounting for household fixed effects, SNAP participation was associated with increased energy purchased among black households. No other significant longitudinal associations between SNAP and purchase outcomes were observed.','SNAP may not be meeting its potential to improve food and beverage purchases or reduce disparities. Research is needed to identify strategies for ensuring nutritious purchases across all racial/ethnic groups."
"Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis (primary and secondary) are at high levels in the USA. Disparities by race, gender and sexual orientation have been characterised, but while there are indications that rural poor populations may also be at distinct risk this has been subjected to little study by comparison. The federally designated Delta Regional Authority, similar in structure to the Appalachian Regional Commission, oversees 252 counties within eight Mississippi Delta states experiencing chronic economic and health disparities. Our objective was to identify differences in infection risk between Delta Region (DR)/non-DR counties and examine how they might vary by rurality, population density, primary care access and education attainment.','Reported chlamydia/gonorrhoea/syphilis data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention AtlasPlus, county demographic data from the Area Health Resource File and rurality classifications from the Department of Agriculture. Data were subjected to analysis by t-test, χ<sup>2</sup> and linear regression to assess geographical disparities in incidence and their association with measures of rurality, population and primary care density, and education.','Overall rates for each infection were significantly higher in DR versus non-DR counties (577.8 vs 330.1/100 000 for chlamydia; 142.8 vs 61.8 for gonorrhoea; 3.6 vs 1.7 for syphilis; all P<0.001) and for nearly every infection for every individual state. DR rates for each infection were near-universally significantly increased for every level of rurality (nine levels) and population density (quintiles). Regression found that primary care and population density and HS graduation rates were significantly associated with each, though model predictive abilities were poor.','The nearly 10 million people living in the DR face significant disparities in the incidence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis-in many instances a near-doubling of risk. Our findings suggest that resource-constrained areas, as measured by rurality, should be considered a priority for future intervention efforts."
"Blacks are two to three times as likely as whites to die of preventable heart disease and stroke. Declines in mortality from heart disease have not eliminated racial disparities. Control and effective treatment of hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, among blacks is less than in whites and remains a challenge. One of the driving forces behind this racial/ethnic disparity is medication nonadherence whose cause is embedded in social determinants. Eight practical approaches to addressing medication adherence with the potential to attenuate disparities were identified and include: (1) patient engagement strategies, (2) consumer-directed health care, (3) patient portals, (4) smart apps and text messages, (5) digital pillboxes, (6) pharmacist-led engagement, (7) cardiac rehabilitation, and (8) cognitive-based behavior. However, while data suggest that these strategies may improve medication adherence, the effect on ameliorating racial/ethnic disparities is not certain. This review describes the relationship between disparities and medication adherence, which likely plays a role in persistent disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
"Using data from the 1999-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n ~ 46,000), this study documents income disparities in the age patterning of cardiovascular conditions across the lifespan in the U.S. The conditions were assessed from laboratory test results, self-reports of medications used to treat specific conditions, and anthropometric measurements, allowing us to capture whether individuals at given ages had developed the various conditions, regardless of previous diagnosis and treatment. We found evidence of large income disparities in the presence of cardiovascular conditions and risk factors for females, smaller disparities in the same conditions for males, and few disparities that increased with age for either gender. Results were very similar when considering disparities by education instead of income. The findings suggest that the widening socioeconomic gradients in health over the lifespan found in many previous studies-which have generally focused on self-rated health, activity limitations, or diagnosed conditions-reflect, at least to some extent, differences in diagnosis, treatment, and management of health conditions rather than age-related differences in developing them. The findings also suggest that preventive healthcare is not an important source of socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular health in the U.S., at least for men. The observed patterns of income disparities in cardiovascular conditions over the lifespan are more consistent with theories of early life conditions and the imprinting of health endowments and susceptibilities early in life than with cumulative life exposure or stress hypotheses."
"Whether racial/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk may be explained by ambient fine particles (PM2.5) has not been studied.','We conducted a prospective, population-based study on a cohort of Black (n=481) and White (n=6004) older women (aged 65-79) without dementia at enrollment (1995-98). Cox models accounting for competing risk were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for racial/ethnic disparities in AD (1996-2010) defined by DSM-IV and the association with time-varying annual average PM2.5 (1999-2010) estimated by spatiotemporal model.','Over an average follow-up of 8.3 (±3.5) years with 158 incident cases (21 in Black women), the racial disparities in AD risk (range of adjusted HRBlack women = 1.85-2.41) observed in various models could not be explained by geographic region, age, socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular risk factors, and hormone therapy assignment. Estimated PM2.5 exposure was higher in Black (14.38±2.21 µg/m 3) than in White (12.55±2.76 µg/m 3) women, and further adjustment for the association between PM2.5 and AD (adjusted HRPM2.5 = 1.18-1.28) slightly reduced the racial disparities by 2-6% (HRBlack women = 1.81-2.26). The observed association between PM2.5 and AD risk was ~2 times greater in Black (HRPM2.5 = 2.10-2.60) than in White (HRPM2.5 = 1.07-1.15) women (range of interaction Ps: <.01 to .01). We found similar results after further adjusting for social engagement (social strain; social support; social activity; living alone), stressful life events, WHI clinic sites, and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics.','PM2.5 may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in AD risk and its associated increase in AD risk was stronger amongst Black women."
"To summarize the most recent evidence on gynecologic cancer disparities and to describe studies investigating the social determinants of health and receipt of evidence-based care and potential interventions to address inequities in care.','Significant disparities in disease-specific survival by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and payer status have persisted in women with gynecologic cancers. Compared with white women, black women have an increased likelihood of disease-specific mortality for endometrial cancer and are less likely to receive guideline-adherent care for ovarian cancer. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought significant attention to the structural barriers that contribute to persistent health disparities and how community-based partnerships with a focus on policy interventions are needed for equitable gynecologic cancer outcomes.','In this review, we discuss structural barriers contributing to racial inequities, the role of Medicaid payer status and receipt of quality cancer care, gender, and racial workforce diversity, and community-based partnerships to create evidence-based interventions to address disparities."
"This chapter synthesizes what is known about the relationship between social disadvantage and measures of low health literacy (LHL), and reviews the research examining whether LHL is an explanatory factor connecting social disadvantage, health outcomes, and health disparities. Written from a U.S. perspective, the chapter then offers a novel conceptual framework that presents how the social determinants of health might interact with LHL to result in health disparities. The framework articulates relationships that reflect public health pathways and healthcare pathways, which include their related health literacies. In addition, the chapter highlights as an exemplar one important potential causal mechanism in the healthcare pathway by exploring the communication model in outpatient care, as communication has been very well-studied with respect to both health disparities and HL. The chapter then, provides two examples of HL interventions aligned with the conceptual framework, one of which addresses the health care literacy pathway, and the other addresses the public health literacy pathway. The chapter continues with a number of cautionary statements based on the inherent limitations of current HL research, including problems and concerns specific to the attribution of HL as an explanatory factor for extant socioeconomic and racial/ethnic health disparities. The chapter closes with recommendations regarding future research directions."
"Racial disparities in the burden of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have been documented and described for decades. Similarly, methodological issues and limitations in the use of disparity measures to quantify disparities in health have also been well documented. The purpose of this study was to use historic STD surveillance data to illustrate four of the most well-known methodological issues associated with the use of disparity measures.','We manually searched STD surveillance reports to find examples of racial/ethnic distributions of reported STDs that illustrate key methodological issues in the use of disparity measures. The disparity measures we calculated included the black-white rate ratio, the Index of Disparity (weighted and unweighted by subgroup population), and the Gini coefficient.','The 4 examples we developed included illustrations of potential differences in relative and absolute disparity measures, potential differences in weighted and nonweighted disparity measures, the importance of the reference point when calculating disparities, and differences in disparity measures in the assessment of trends in disparities over time. For example, the gonorrhea rate increased for all minority groups (relative to whites) from 1992 to 1993, yet the Index of Disparity suggested that racial/ethnic disparities had decreased.','Although imperfect, disparity measures can be useful to quantify racial/ethnic disparities in STDs, to assess trends in these disparities, and to inform interventions to reduce these disparities. Our study uses reported STD rates to illustrate potential methodological issues with these disparity measures and highlights key considerations when selecting disparity measures for quantifying disparities in STDs."
"<b><i>Objective:</i></b> In the United States, there have been very few improvements in adverse birth outcomes, such as infant mortality, low birthweight, and preterm birth in recent years. Health promotion before pregnancy (<i>e.g.</i>, preconception care) has been increasingly recognized as an important strategy by which to improve these reproductive outcomes. As of yet, no research has examined sexual orientation disparities in preconception health which has important implications for birth outcomes in the United States, since sexual minority women (SMW) are more likely to report stillbirths, low birthweight, and preterm infants than heterosexual women. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This study addresses this gap by utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine sexual orientation disparities in women's preconception health 1 and 3 years before a live birth (<i>n</i> = 3,133). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Our findings suggest that, even after controlling for maternal characteristics, SMW are more likely to report adverse health conditions and behaviors before pregnancy relative to heterosexual women 1 year before the survey, including higher odds of binge drinking, other substance use, having a sexually transmitted infection diagnosis, and depression. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Despite new public health policies aimed at improved preconception health, our findings suggest that SMW are even more vulnerable to poor preconception health than their heterosexual counterparts, which has important implications for maternal and child health. This study provides important evidence for the need to invest in the reproductive health of SMW, particularly in the context of pregnancy."
"Black patients are at higher risk of revision total knee replacement (TKR) than White patients, but whether racial disparities exist for both septic and aseptic revision TKR and the reason for any disparities are unknown.','To assess the risk of septic and aseptic revision TKR in Black and White patients and to examine interactions among race and socioeconomic and hospital-related variables that are associated with revision TKR risk.','This cohort study included residents of New York, California, and Florida who underwent TKR. Patient-level data were obtained from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Patient Discharge Database, and Florida's Healthcare Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014. Community characteristics were calculated from the US Census and linked to discharges by patient zip code. American Hospital Association Annual Survey data were linked to discharges using hospital identifiers. The analyses were performed from March 1 to October 30, 2020, with subsequent analyses in April 2021.','Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to measure the association of race with septic and aseptic revision TKR.','A total of 722 492 patients underwent primary TKR, of whom 445 616 (61.68%) were female and 61 092 (8.46%) were Black. Black patients were at higher risk of septic (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20) and aseptic (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.33-1.46) revision TKR compared with White patients. Other risk factors for septic revision TKR were diabetes (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30), obesity (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30), kidney disease (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.29-1.57), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15-1.30), inflammatory arthritis (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.39-1.69), surgical site complications during the index TKR (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.87-2.56), Medicaid insurance (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31), and low annual TKR volume at the hospital where the index TKR was performed (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.41-1.68). Risk factors for aseptic revision TKR were male sex (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06), workers' compensation insurance (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.51-1.72), and low hospital TKR volume (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07-1.22). Patients with obesity had a lower risk of aseptic TKR revision (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.84). In an analysis within each category of hospital TKR volume, the HR for aseptic revision among Black vs White patients was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.04-1.37) at very-low-volume hospitals (≤89 TKRs annually) compared with 1.68 (95% CI, 1.48-1.90) at very-high-volume hospitals (≥645 TKRs annually).','In this cohort study, Black patients were at significantly higher risk of aseptic revision TKR and, to a lesser extent, septic revision TKR compared with White patients. Racial disparities in aseptic revision risk were greatest at hospitals with very high TKR volumes."
"Evidence is limited on racial/ethnic group disparities in multimorbidity and associated health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries hampering effective policies and clinical interventions to address health inequalities.','This study assessed race/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of multimorbidity and associated healthcare utilisation, costs and death in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A cross-sectional analysis was carried out of 3,027,335 individuals registered with primary healthcare (PHC) services. Records included linked data to hospitalisation, mortality, and welfare-claimant (Bolsa Família) records between 1 Jan 2012 and 31 Dec 2016. Logistic and Poisson regression models were carried out to assess the likelihood of multimorbidity (two or more diagnoses out of 53 chronic conditions), PHC use, hospital admissions and mortality from any cause. Interactions were used to assess disparities.','In total 13,509,633 healthcare visits were analysed identifying 389,829 multimorbid individuals (13%). In adjusted regression models, multimorbidity was associated with lower education (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.26; 95%CI: 1.23,1.29; compared to higher education), Bolsa Família receipt (AOR: 1.14; 95%CI: 1.13,1.15; compared to non-recipients); and black race/ethnicity (AOR: 1.05; 95%CI: 1.03,1.06; compared to white). Multimorbidity was associated with more hospitalisations (Adjusted Rate Ratio (ARR): 2.75; 95%CI: 2.69,2.81), more PHC visits (ARR: 3.46; 95%CI: 3.44,3.47), and higher likelihood of death (AOR: 1.33; 95%CI: 1.29,1.36). These associations were greater for multimorbid individuals with lower educational attainment (five year probability of death 1.67% (95%CI: 1.61,1.74%) compared to 1.13% (95%CI: 1.02,1.23%) for higher education), individuals of black race/ethnicity (1.48% (95%CI: 1.41,1.55%) compared to 1.35% (95%CI: 1.31,1.40%) for white) and individuals in receipt of welfare (1.89% (95%CI: 1.77,2.00%) compared to 1.35% (95%CI: 1.31,1.38%) for non-recipients).','The prevalence of multimorbidity and associated hospital admissions and mortality are greater in individuals with black race/ethnicity and other deprived socioeconomic groups in Rio de Janeiro. Interventions to better prevent and manage multimorbidity and underlying disparities in low- and middle-income country settings are needed."

"Latino child populations are large and growing, and they present considerable unmet need for mental health treatment. Poverty, lack of health insurance, limited English proficiency, stigma, undocumented status, and inhospitable programming are among many factors that contribute to Latino-White mental health treatment disparities. Lower treatment expenditures serve as an important marker of Latino children's low rates of mental health treatment and limited participation once enrolled in services.','We investigated whether total Latino-White expenditure disparities declined when autonomous, county-level mental health plans receive funds free of customary cost-sharing charges, especially when they capitalized on cultural and language-sensitive mental health treatment programs as vehicles to receive and spend treatment funds. Using Whites as benchmark, we considered expenditure pattern disparities favoring Whites over Latinos and, in a smaller number of counties, Latinos over Whites.','Using segmented regression for interrupted time series on county level treatment systems observed over 64 quarters, we analyzed Medi-Cal paid claims for per-user total expenditures for mental health services delivered to children and youth (under 18 years of age) during a study period covering July 1, 1991 through June 30, 2007. Settlement-mandated Medicaid's Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) expenditure increases began in the third quarter of 1995. Terms were introduced to assess immediate and long term inequality reduction as well as the role of culture and language-sensitive community-based programs.','Settlement-mandated increased EPSDT treatment funding was associated with more spending on Whites relative to Latinos unless plans arranged for cultural and language-sensitive mental health treatment programs. However, having programs served more to prevent expenditure disparities from growing than to reduce disparities.','EPSDT expanded funding increased proportional expenditures for Whites absent cultural and language-sensitive treatment programs. The programs moderate, but do not overcome, entrenched expenditure disparities. These findings use investment in mental health services for Latino populations to indicate treatment access and utilization, but do not explicitly reflect penetration rates or intensity of services for consumers.','New funding, along with an expectation that Latino children's well documented mental health treatment disparities will be addressed, holds potential for improved mental health access and reducing utilization inequities for this population, especially when specialized, culturally and linguistically sensitive mental health treatment programs are present to serve as recipients of funding.','To further expand knowledge of how federal or state funding for community based mental health services for low income populations can drive down the longstanding and considerable Latino-White mental health treatment disparities, we must develop and test questions targeting policy drivers which can channel funding to programs and organizations aimed at delivering linguistically and culturally sensitive services to Latino children and their families."
"Goals for improving the quality of care for all Veterans and eliminating health disparities are outlined in the Veterans Health Administration Blueprint for Excellence, but the degree to which disparities in utilization, health outcomes, and quality of care affect Veterans is not well understood.','To characterize the research on health care disparities in the Veterans Health Administration by means of a map of the evidence.','We conducted a systematic search for research studies published from 2006 to February 2016 in MEDLINE and other data sources. We included studies of Veteran populations that examined disparities in 3 outcome categories: utilization, quality of health care, and patient health.','We abstracted data on study design, setting, population, clinical area, outcomes, mediators, and presence of disparity for each outcome category. We grouped the data by population characteristics including race, disability status, mental illness, demographics (age, era of service, rural location, and distance from care), sex identity, socioeconomic status, and homelessness, and created maps illustrating the evidence.','We reviewed 4249 citations and abstracted data from 351 studies which met inclusion criteria. Studies examining disparities by race/ethnicity comprised by far the vast majority of the literature, followed by studies examining disparities by sex, and mental health condition. Very few studies examined disparities related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender identity or homelessness. Disparities findings vary widely by population and outcome.','Our evidence maps provide a ""lay of the land"" and identify important gaps in knowledge about health disparities experienced by different Veteran populations."
"In 1971, President Nixon signed into law the National Cancer Act (NCA), colloquially known as the ""War on Cancer"", which pushed cancer onto the national agenda and is credited for many subsequent increases in the knowledge of the molecular, cellular, and genetic causes and effects of cancer. But even though cancer mortality has declined overall in intervening years after the NCA, cancer health disparities persist in the form of higher cancer incidence and mortality rates among certain cancer types and certain populations. Breast and cervical cancers disproportionately affect African American, Hispanic, and American Indian Women. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death for Latinos (with men and women combined). Forty-five years after the NCA, how will the next enormous cancer initiatives-President Barack Obama's Cancer Moonshot and the All of Us Research Program (formerly the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program)-impact cancer health disparities? The emergence of precision medicine and the sharing of information across sectors are at the heart of these large national initiatives and hold vast potential to address complex health disparities that remain in incidence reporting, incidence, treatment, prognoses, and mortality among certain cancer types and racial/ethnic minorities, including African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos, compared to Whites. But clinical research efforts and data collection have historically lacked diverse representation for various reasons, posing a large risk to these national initiatives in their ability to develop diverse cohorts that adequately represent racial/ethnic minorities. Efforts to reduce disparities and increase diversity in study cohorts have emerged, from patient navigation, to use of mobile technology to collect data, to national consortiums dedicated to including diverse groups, to university training on health disparities. These efforts point to the need for the Cancer Moonshot and precision medicine leaders to develop a multifaceted approach to address disparities in health and healthcare to promote a diverse healthcare workforce, patient-centered care, maintenance of a database of information regarding the state of health disparities, and the institution of measurable goals for improving care across all ethnic groups. If these elements are included, it is possible that the Cancer Moonshot and precision medicine will benefit the entire population of our country."
"<b>Background:</b> A population-based program promoting the Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) for colorectal cancer screening was introduced in 2008 in Ontario, Canada, where opportunistic screening with colonoscopy had been increasing in frequency. We evaluated the impact of the program on income and immigration-related disparities in screening.<b>Methods:</b> We used linked administrative data to calculate colorectal cancer screening rates for eligible Ontarians in each year between 2001/02 (<i>n</i> = 2,852,619) and 2013/14 (<i>n</i> = 4,139,304). We quantified disparities using an ""inequality ratio"" of screening rates in the most disadvantaged group relative to the most advantaged group. We performed segmented logistic regression analyses stratified by screening modality and adjusted for age, sex, rurality, comorbidity, and morbidity.<b>Results:</b> Between 2001/02 and 2013/14, the income and immigration inequality ratios narrowed from 0.74 to 0.80 and 0.55 to 0.69, respectively. Before the screening program, the income inequality ratio was widening by 1% per year (95% CI 1% to 1%); in the year it was introduced, it narrowed by 4% (95% CI 2% to 7%) and in the years following, it remained stable [0% decrease (95% CI 1% decrease to 0% decrease) per year]. Results were similar for immigration-related disparities. After program introduction, disparities in receiving FOBT were narrowing at a faster rate while disparities in receiving colonoscopy were widening at a slower rate.<b>Conclusions:</b> Introduction of a population-based screening program promoting FOBT for colorectal cancer was associated with only modest improvements in immigration and income-related disparities.<b>Impact:</b> Reducing immigration and income-related disparities should be a focus for future research and policy work. Disparities in Ontario seem to be driven by a higher uptake of colonoscopy among more advantaged groups. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(9); 1401-10. ©2017 AACR</i>."
"Relying on data from a nationally representative sample of youth involved in the child welfare system (CWS) in 1999-2000 (the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, Cohort 1) and 2008-2009 (Cohort 2), this study implemented a diverse set of disparity indicators to estimate area-socioeconomic disparities in mental health (MH) services use and changes in area-socioeconomic disparities between the two cohorts. Our study found that there are area-socioeconomic disparities in MH service use, indicating that the rates of MH service use among youth referred to the CWS differ by area-socioeconomic positions defined by county-level poverty rates. We also found that area-socioeconomic disparities increased over time. However, the magnitude of the increase varied widely across disparity measures, suggesting that there are different conclusions about the trend and magnitude of area-socioeconomic disparities, depending upon which disparity measures are implemented. A greater understanding of the methodological differences among disparity measures is warranted, which will in turn impact how interventions are designed to reduce socioeconomic disparities among children in the CWS."
"Low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates early after introduction, particularly among low income and minority adolescents, may have resulted in disparities in vaccine-type HPV prevalence (types 6, 11, 16, 18). The purpose of this study was to examine racial/ethnic variations in HPV prevalence, and evaluate how HPV vaccination has affected vaccine-type HPV prevalence across time.','This study was a retrospective analysis of 6 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2003-2014). Results on HPV status from vaginal samples of 14-26 year old females who responded about HPV vaccination were used to determine HPV prevalence. Prevaccine HPV prevalence was compared to post-licensure prevalence. Racial/ethnic comparisons were made across time, and models were developed to examine the role of HPV vaccination in observed variations for vaccine-type HPV prevalence.','Among 4080 females, 29.7% were black, 25.6% were Mexican American, 8.9% were Hispanic, and 35.8% were white. Compared to prevaccine years (2003-2006), vaccine-type HPV did not decrease until late post-licensure years (2011-2014; 14.2% vs. 5.2%, p < 0.001). Most of the decrease occurred among white females between prevaccine and late post-licensure periods (15.2% vs. 4.1%, p < 0.001). Although a decrease in prevalence was observed among black females during the same periods (16.9% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.05), it was not as large as among white females. Prevalence decreased among Mexican Americans (8.2 vs. 4.0, p > 0.05) during the same periods, but the difference was not significant. Interactions between race and time were significant (p < 0.001), with uneven vaccination between black and white females contributing to the disparities observed.','HPV vaccination was low in among black and Mexican American females, which contributed to disparities in HPV prevalence. Increasing vaccination among all adolescents, particularly 11-12 year olds, is important because most children this age will not have been exposed."
"Cambodia has made significant economic, political, and health advancements with the implementation of the millennium development goals (MDG). Important gaps in child health still exist, however, and accurate assessments of lingering disparities within the country will be essential for meeting the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.','This investigation hypothesised that child-health improvements in rural areas of Cambodia continue to lag behind urban areas. The study objective was to identify specific disparities in rural achievement of MDG within Cambodia to direct future work in child health.','Surveys were conducted in 230 rural households in four villages in Kampot and Kampong Speu provinces to assess risk factors contributing to lack of village-level achievement of MDG. National urban and rural data were used for comparison.','An under-5 death in the preceding year was reported by 11.5% (n = 26) of the households surveyed. Under-use of common public health interventions (vaccinations, clean drinking water, oral rehydration therapy, iodised salt, bed nets, antenatal care, and improved sanitation facilities) was observed in all villages. Under-use of the interventions was more common in rural than urban areas.','Achievement of child-health-related MDG lags in rural areas of Cambodia. Child health risk factors varied widely among villages. Village-specific risk factors for which immediate action can be taken are a priority, particularly vaccination in Angkcheay and Takoa and clean drinking water in Pos Pong. Elimination of disparities in rural child health will ultimately require significant resource allocation in rural areas, e.g. improved sanitation facilities, piped water supply and sustained public health initiatives."
"There is a paucity of research seeking to understand race disparities in obesity among individuals living in a gentrifying neighborhood. American Community Survey data were used to identify gentrifying neighborhoods. In a cross-sectional analysis, these data were then linked to the 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, yielding an analytic sample of 887 Black and White adults. Obesity was based on body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. After controlling for potential confounders, Black adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods had a higher prevalence of obesity (PR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.88) than White adults living in gentrifying neighborhoods. Gentrification may have no impact on reducing Black-White obesity disparities in the US."
"Recent advances in our understanding of racial disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality that disproportionately affect African American (AA) men have provided important insights into the psychosocial, socioeconomic, environmental, and molecular contributors. There is, however, limited mechanistic knowledge of how the interplay between these determinants influences prostate tumor aggressiveness in AA men and other men of African ancestry. Growing evidence indicates that chronic psychosocial stress in AA populations leads to sustained glucocorticoid signaling through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), with negative physiological and pathological consequences. Compelling evidence indicates that treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with anti-androgen therapy activates GR signaling. This enhanced GR signaling bypasses androgen receptor (AR) signaling and transcriptionally activates both AR-target genes and GR-target genes, resulting in increased prostate tumor resistance to anti-androgen therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Given its enhanced signaling in AA men, GR-together with specific genetic drivers-may promote CRPC progression and exacerbate tumor aggressiveness in this population, potentially contributing to PCa mortality disparities. Ongoing and future CRPC clinical trials that combine standard of care therapies with GR modulators should assess racial differences in therapy response and clinical outcomes in order to improve PCa health disparities that continue to exist for AA men."
"<b>Objectives.</b> To determine the impact of disaggregated mortality and health surveillance data on the ability to identify health disparities for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) subpopulations. <b>Methods.</b> We conducted a systematic review of reporting categories for AI/AN decedents on official death certificates for all 50 US states. Using public data from the 2017-2018 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), we conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess disparities in health conditions and outcomes for tribally enrolled and non‒tribally enrolled AI/AN persons compared with non-Hispanic Whites. <b>Results.</b> There was no standard for the collection of tribal enrollment data or AI/AN race on death certificates across all 50 states. There were stark differences in the incidence and prevalence of various health risk factors and chronic diseases for the tribally enrolled AI/AN subpopulation, non‒tribally enrolled AI/AN subpopulation, and non-Hispanic White comparison group. <b>Conclusions.</b> The collection of tribal enrollment data in vital statistics and health surveillance systems is necessary to identify and respond to health disparities among AI/AN subpopulations. These efforts must be conducted in partnership with tribal nations and consider Indigenous data sovereignty."
"Socioeconomic factors in the disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have been reported in studies from the US and other Western countries. However, no studies have documented national- or subnational-level outcome disparities in Asian countries.','To assess the association between regional COVID-19 outcome disparities and socioeconomic characteristics in Japan.','This cross-sectional study collected and analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths (through February 13, 2021) as well as population and socioeconomic data in all 47 prefectures in Japan. The data sources were government surveys for which prefecture-level data were available.','Prefectural socioeconomic characteristics included mean annual household income, Gini coefficient, proportion of the population receiving public assistance, educational attainment, unemployment rate, employment in industries with frequent close contacts with the public, household crowding, smoking rate, and obesity rate.','Rate ratios (RRs) of COVID-19 incidence and mortality by prefecture-level socioeconomic characteristics.','All 47 prefectures in Japan (with a total population of 126.2 million) were included in this analysis. A total of 412 126 confirmed COVID-19 cases (326.7 per 100 000 people) and 6910 deaths (5.5 per 100 000 people) were reported as of February 13, 2021. Elevated adjusted incidence and mortality RRs of COVID-19 were observed in prefectures with the lowest household income (incidence RR: 1.45 [95% CI, 1.43-1.48] and mortality RR: 1.81 [95% CI, 1.59-2.07]); highest proportion of the population receiving public assistance (1.55 [95% CI, 1.52-1.58] and 1.51 [95% CI, 1.35-1.69]); highest unemployment rate (1.56 [95% CI, 1.53-1.59] and 1.85 [95% CI, 1.65-2.09]); highest percentage of workers in retail industry (1.36 [95% CI, 1.34-1.38] and 1.45 [95% CI, 1.31-1.61]), transportation and postal industries (1.61 [95% CI, 1.57-1.64] and 2.55 [95% CI, 2.21-2.94]), and restaurant industry (2.61 [95% CI, 2.54-2.68] and 4.17 [95% CI, 3.48-5.03]); most household crowding (1.35 [95% CI, 1.31-1.38] and 1.04 [95% CI, 0.87-1.24]); highest smoking rate (1.63 [95% CI, 1.60-1.66] and 1.54 [95% CI, 1.33-1.78]); and highest obesity rate (0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95] and 1.17 [95% CI, 1.01-1.34]) compared with prefectures with the most social advantages. Among potential mediating variables, higher smoking rate (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.33-1.78) and obesity rate (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34) were associated with higher mortality RRs, even after adjusting for prefecture-level covariates and other socioeconomic variables.','This cross-sectional study found a pattern of socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in Japan that was similar to that observed in the US and Europe. National policy in Japan could consider prioritizing populations in socially disadvantaged regions in the COVID-19 response, such as vaccination planning, to address this pattern."
"Disparities in multimorbidity prevalence indicate health inequalities, as the risk of morbidity does not intrinsically differ by race/ethnicity. This study aimed to determine if multimorbidity differences by race/ethnicity are decreasing over time.','Serial cross-sectional analysis of the National Health Interview Survey, 1999-2018. Included individuals were ≥18 years old and categorized by self-reported race, ethnicity, age, and income. The main outcomes were temporal trends in multimorbidity prevalence based on the self-reported presence of ≥2 of 9 common chronic conditions.','The study sample included 596,355 individuals (4.7% Asian, 11.8% Black, 13.8% Latino/Hispanic, and 69.7% White). In 1999, the estimated prevalence of multimorbidity was 5.9% among Asian, 17.4% among Black, 10.7% among Latino/Hispanic, and 13.5% among White individuals. Prevalence increased for all racial/ethnic groups during the study period (P≤0.001 for each), with no significant change in the differences between them. In 2018, compared with White individuals, multimorbidity was more prevalent among Black individuals (+2.5 percentage points) and less prevalent among Asian and Latino individuals (-6.6 and -2.1 percentage points, respectively). Among those aged ≥30 years, Black individuals had multimorbidity prevalence equivalent to that of Latino/Hispanic and White individuals aged 5 years older, and Asian individuals aged 10 years older.','From 1999 to 2018, a period of increasing multimorbidity prevalence for all the groups studied, there was no significant progress in eliminating disparities between Black and White individuals. Public health interventions that prevent the onset of chronic conditions in early life may be needed to eliminate these disparities."
"Racial/ethnic differences in health care are pervasive in the USA, but the literature is limited with regards to racial disparities in the treatment of dermatologic diseases.','Data on the management of skin ulcers was analyzed from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) from 2012 to 2018. Data distributions between Blacks and Whites, chi-squared statistics, and Fisher Exact Tests were computed to identify significant differences in demographic factors, patient encounter characteristics, and medication prescribed, as a function of race.','Blacks were less likely than Whites to receive: care by a physician (<i>p</i> = .0389), a skin examination (<i>p</i> < .0001), or cryotherapy (<i>p</i> < .0175). Blacks were more likely to be seen by a nurse practitioner (<i>p</i> = .0359). Whites were 6.698 times more likely than Blacks to have a follow up visit scheduled after 2 months or more.','Our data suggests that among outpatient visits for skin ulcers in the USA, racial disparities exist in the probability of seeing a physician, receiving treatment, and follow-up care. Further research must be conducted and interventions implemented in order to combat racial disparities in Black patients' access to dermatologic treatment for skin ulcers."
"Esophageal cancer and gastric cancer are two important causes of upper GI malignancies. Literature has shown that minimally invasive esophagectomies (MIE) and gastrectomies (MIG), have shorter length of stay and fewer complications. However, limited literature exists about the association between race and access to MIE and MIG. This study aims to identify the racial disparities in the different approaches to esophagectomy and gastrectomy. We further evaluate the relationship between the race and postoperative complications.','This IRB-approved retrospective study utilized data from the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program. All recorded cases of MIE, MIG, open gastrectomy, and esophagectomy between 2012 and 2019 were isolated. Propensity score matching and univariate analysis was performed to assess the independent effect of black self-identified race on access and outcomes. p < 0.05 was required to achieve statistical significance.','7891 cases of esophagectomy and 5,132 cases of gastrectomy cases were identified. Using Propensity and logistic regression, we identified that black self-reported race is an independent predictor of open approach to gastrectomy (OR 1.6871943, 95% CI 1.431464-1.989829, p < 0.001). Black self-reported race was not predictive of operative approach among esophagectomy patients (OR 0.7942576, 95% CI 0.5698645-1.124228, p = 0.183). In contrast, black self-reported is an independent predictor of postoperative complications among esophagectomy patients only. Esophagectomy patients of black self-reported race were more likely to experience any complication (OR 1.4373437, 95% CI 1.1129239-1.8557096, p = 0.00537), severe complications (OR 1.3818966, 95% CI 1.0653087-1.7888454, p = 0.0144), and death (OR 2.00779762, 95% CI 1.08034921-3.56117535, p = 0.0211) within 30 days of their surgeries.','Our analysis revealed a significant racial disparity in access to MIG and a higher incidence of post-operative complications amongst esophagectomy patients. Minimally invasive techniques are underutilized in racial minorities. The findings herein warrant further investigation to eliminate barriers and disparities."
"Historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups are generally more likely to experience sleep deficiencies. It is unclear how these sleep duration disparities have changed during recent years.','To evaluate 15-year trends in racial and ethnic differences in self-reported sleep duration among adults in the US.','This serial cross-sectional study used US population-based National Health Interview Survey data collected from 2004 to 2018. A total of 429 195 noninstitutionalized adults were included in the analysis, which was performed from July 26, 2021, to February 10, 2022.','Self-reported race, ethnicity, household income, and sex.','Temporal trends and racial and ethnic differences in short (<7 hours in 24 hours) and long (>9 hours in 24 hours) sleep duration and racial and ethnic differences in the association between sleep duration and age.','The study sample consisted of 429 195 individuals (median [IQR] age, 46 [31-60] years; 51.7% women), of whom 5.1% identified as Asian, 11.8% identified as Black, 14.7% identified as Hispanic or Latino, and 68.5% identified as White. In 2004, the adjusted estimated prevalence of short and long sleep duration were 31.4% and 2.5%, respectively, among Asian individuals; 35.3% and 6.4%, respectively, among Black individuals; 27.0% and 4.6%, respectively, among Hispanic or Latino individuals; and 27.8% and 3.5%, respectively, among White individuals. During the study period, there was a significant increase in short sleep prevalence among Black (6.39 [95% CI, 3.32-9.46] percentage points), Hispanic or Latino (6.61 [95% CI, 4.03-9.20] percentage points), and White (3.22 [95% CI, 2.06-4.38] percentage points) individuals (P < .001 for each), whereas prevalence of long sleep changed significantly only among Hispanic or Latino individuals (-1.42 [95% CI, -2.52 to -0.32] percentage points; P = .01). In 2018, compared with White individuals, short sleep prevalence among Black and Hispanic or Latino individuals was higher by 10.68 (95% CI, 8.12-13.24; P < .001) and 2.44 (95% CI, 0.23-4.65; P = .03) percentage points, respectively, and long sleep prevalence was higher only among Black individuals (1.44 [95% CI, 0.39-2.48] percentage points; P = .007). The short sleep disparities were greatest among women and among those with middle or high household income. In addition, across age groups, Black individuals had a higher short and long sleep duration prevalence compared with White individuals of the same age.','The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that from 2004 to 2018, the prevalence of short and long sleep duration was persistently higher among Black individuals in the US. The disparities in short sleep duration appear to be highest among women, individuals who had middle or high income, and young or middle-aged adults, which may be associated with health disparities."
"The authors sought to describe disparities in three outcomes: self-reported mental health, need for mental health care, and barriers to care at the intersection of sexual identity and sex.','Data from the 2015 Association of American Medical Colleges Consumer Survey of Health Care Access (N=5,932) were analyzed in regression analyses to estimate relationships among sex, sexual identity, and all three outcomes.','Compared with heterosexual men, bisexual women reported the poorest mental health (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR]=0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.35-0.51) and the greatest number of barriers to care (APR=2.29, 95% CI=1.77-2.97), whereas gay-lesbian women reported the most frequent need for care (APR=1.67, 95% CI=1.28-2.18).','The findings support existing knowledge on health inequities among sexual minority groups and situate these disparities in the context of unequal access to behavioral and mental health care. As such, addressing barriers to care is paramount in efforts to address sexual orientation-related disparities in behavioral and mental health."
"Urologic cancer disparities based on race/ethnicity and gender are well-documented across the cancer continuum. Patients cared for by physicians of similar race/ethnicity and gender report better communication, patient satisfaction, and care adherence which has the potential to translate into better health outcomes. We believe that ensuring a diverse Urologic Oncology workforce is an important first step toward eliminating cancer disparities due to the downstream effects of improved communication between concordant patient-physician dyads. In this essay, we review the demographics of the Urologic cancer patient population and Urologic Oncology workforce; describe current evidence supporting healthcare workforce diversity, especially related to race and gender-based concordant patient-physician relationships; and make recommendations for individual and institutional strategies to develop and support a diverse workforce in Urologic Oncology."
"Prior studies identified significant racial disparities as well as regional variation in outcomes of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We aimed to determine whether regional variation contributes to these racial disparities.','We identified all white or black patients who underwent infrainguinal revascularization or amputation in 15 deidentified regions of the Vascular Quality Initiative between 2003 and 2017. We excluded three regions with <100 procedures. We used multivariable linear regression, allowing clustering at the hospital level to calculate the marginal effects of race and region on adjusted 30-day mortality, major adverse limb events (MALEs), and amputation. We compared long-term outcomes between black and white patients within each region and within patients of each race treated in different regions using multivariable Cox regression.','We identified 90,418 patients, 15,527 (17%) of whom were black. Patients underwent 31,263 bypasses, 52,462 endovascular interventions, and 6693 amputations. Black patients were younger and less likely to smoke, to have coronary artery disease, or to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but they were more likely to have diabetes, limb-threatening ischemia, dialysis dependence, and hypertension and to be self-insured or on Medicaid (all P < .05). Adjusted 30-day mortality ranged from 1.2% to 2.1% across regions for white patients and 0% to 3.0% for black patients; adjusted 30-day MALE varied from 4.0% to 8.3% for white patients and 2.4% to 8.1% for black patients; and adjusted 30-day amputation rates varied from 0.3% to 1.2% for white patients and 0% to 2.1% for black patients. Black patients experienced significantly different (both higher and lower) adjusted rates of 30-day mortality and amputation than white patients did in several regions (P < .05) but not MALEs. In addition, within each racial group, we found significant variation in the adjusted rates of all outcomes between regions (all P < .01). In adjusted analyses, compared with white patients, black patients experienced consistently lower long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.88; P < .001) and higher rates of MALEs (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.25; P < .001) and amputation (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.51; P < .001), with no statistically significant variation across the regions. However, rates of all long-term outcomes varied within both racial groups across regions.','Significant racial disparities exist in outcomes after lower extremity procedures in patients with PAD, with regional variation contributing to perioperative but not long-term outcome disparities. Underperforming regions should use these data to generate quality improvement projects, as understanding the etiology of these disparities is critical to improving the care of all patients with PAD."
"Chronic discrimination and associated socioeconomic inequalities have shaped the health and well-being of Black Americans. As a consequence of the intersection of these factors with rural deprivation, rural Black Americans live and work in particularly pathogenic environments that generate disproportionate and interacting chronic comorbidities (syndemics) compared to their White and/or urban counterparts. Traditional prevention research has been unable to fully capture the underlying complexity of rural minority health and has generated mostly low-leverage interventions that have failed to reverse adverse metabolic outcomes among rural Black Americans. In contrast, novel research approaches-such as system dynamics modeling-that seek to understand holistic system structure and determine complex health outcomes over time provide a robust framework to develop a more accurate understanding of the key factors contributing to type 2 diabetes. This framework can then be used to establish more efficacious interventions to address disparities among minorities in rural areas. This paper advocates for a unified complex systems epistemology and methodology in advancing rural minority health disparities research. Toward this goal, we (1) provide an overview of rural Black American metabolic health research, (2) introduce a complex systems framework in rural minority health disparities research, and (3) demonstrate how community-based system dynamics modeling and simulation can help us plow new ground in rural minority health disparities research and action. We anticipate that this paper can serve as a catalyst for a long-overdue discourse on the relevance of complex systems approaches in minority health research, with practical benefits for numerous disproportionately burdened communities."
"Older adults from racial and ethnic minority groups are likely to face disparities in their health as well as care experiences in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities just as they do in the United States as a whole. Policymakers in the United States face concerns around long-term services and supports to address the growing demands of a rapidly aging population through public and private sector initiatives. It is important to create inclusive and culturally responsive environments to meet the needs of diverse groups of older adults. In spite of federal policy that supports minority health and protects the well-being of long-term care facility residents, racial and ethnic disparities persist in long-term care facilities. This manuscript describes supports and gaps in the current United States' federal policy to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in long-term care facilities. Implications for social workers are discussed and recommendations include efforts to revise portions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, amending regulations regarding long-term care facilities' training and oversight, and tailoring the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program's data collection, analysis, and reporting requirements to include racial and ethnic demographic data."
"Despite improved understanding of the risks of influenza and better vaccines for older patients, influenza vaccination rates remain subpar, including in high-risk groups such as older adults, and demonstrate significant racial and ethnic disparities.','This study considers demographic, clinical, and geographic correlates of influenza vaccination among Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries in 2015-2016 and maps the data on a geographic information system (GIS) at the zip code level.','Analyses confirm that only half of the senior beneficiaries evidenced a claim for receiving an inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), with significant disparities observed among black, Hispanic, rural, and poorer beneficiaries. More extensive disparities were observed for the high-dose (HD) vaccine, with its added protection for older populations and confirmed economic benefit. Most white beneficiaries received HD; no non-white subgroup did so. Mapping of the data confirmed subpar vaccination in vulnerable populations with wide variations at the zip code level.','Urgent and targeted efforts are needed to equitably increase IIV rates, thus protecting the most vulnerable populations from the negative health impact of influenza as well as the tax-paying public from the Medicare costs from failing to do so."
"American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) continue to experience extreme lung cancer health disparities. The state of Minnesota is home to over 70,000 AI/AN, and this population has a 2-fold increase in lung cancer mortality compared to other races within Minnesota. Genetic mutation testing in lung cancer is now a standard of high-quality lung cancer care, and EGFR mutation testing has been recommended for all adenocarcinoma lung cases, regardless of smoking status. However, genetic testing is a controversial topic for some AI/AN.','We performed a multisite retrospective chart review funded by the Minnesota Precision Medicine Grand Challenge as a demonstration project to examine lung cancer health disparities in AI/AN. We sought to measure epidemiology of lung cancer among AI receiving diagnosis or treatment in Minnesota cancer referral centers as well as rate of EGFR testing. The primary outcome was the rate of EGFR mutational analysis testing among cases and controls with nonsquamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. We secured collaborations with 5 health care systems covering a diverse geographic and demographic population.','We identified 200 cases and 164 matched controls from these sites. Controls were matched on histology, smoking status, sex, and age. In both groups, about one third of subjects with adenocarcinoma received genetic mutation testing.','There was no significant difference in mutation testing in AI compared to non-AI controls at large health care systems in Minnesota. These data indicate that other factors are likely contributing to the higher mortality in this group."
"ISSUE: Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to face barriers in access to health care. GOAL: Assess the effect of the ACA’s major coverage expansions on disparities in access to care among adults. METHODS: Analysis of nationally representative data from the American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Between 2013 and 2015, disparities with whites narrowed for blacks and Hispanics on three key access indicators: the percentage of uninsured working-age adults, the percentage who skipped care because of costs, and the percentage who lacked a usual care provider. Disparities were narrower, and the average rate on each of the three indicators for whites, blacks, and Hispanics was lower in both 2013 and 2015 in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA than in states that did not expand. Among Hispanics, disparities tended to narrow more between 2013 and 2015 in expansion states than nonexpansion states. The ACA’s coverage expansions were associated with increased access to care and reduced racial and ethnic disparities in access to care, with generally greater improvements in Medicaid expansion states."
"In response to the Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities' (NIMHD) new health disparities research framework, we call on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to acknowledge Arabs in the United States as a health disparity population. Arab classification as White leads to their cultural invisibility and perpetuates a cycle of undocumented health disparities.We provide examples of how this contested identity reinforces challenges associated with identifying this population and contributes to enactments of structural violence and undocumented health disparities. Decades of research with Arabs in the United States provides consistent evidence that their health does not fit the health profile of White Americans and that Arabs do not benefit from Whiteness and White privilege associated with their White racial categorization. On the contrary, Arabs in the United States experience discrimination and health disparities that require urgent attention; this can be achieved only by identifying the population with a racial category other than White.We conclude with recommendations to NIH and NIMHD to revise their definition of health disparity populations to include Arabs in the United States."
"Prior studies in the civilian population have demonstrated racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes following surgical treatment, including inferior quality of care and worse survival. It is unclear if racial disparities exist in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.','Do racial disparities impact early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes after surgical treatment within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)?','We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Veterans with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing surgical treatment in the VHA system. We evaluated demographic characteristics, access to care, surgical quality measures, and short- and long-term oncologic outcomes between White and Black Veterans.','From 2006 to 2016, 18,800 Veterans with clinical stage I NSCLC were included. The rates of definitive surgical treatment were similar between Black (57.3%) and White (58.1%) Veterans (p=0.42). The final study cohort included 9,842 patients receiving surgical treatment, of whom 8,356 (84.9%) were White and 1,486 (15.1%) were Black. Black patients were younger and more likely to smoke, though comorbidities were similar between the two groups. While Black patients were somewhat less likely to receive adequate lymph node sampling (30.3% vs 33.6%, p=0.050), other access to care metrics and surgical quality measures including rates of anatomic lobectomy (71.9% vs 69.4%, p=0.189) and positive margins (3.2% vs. 3.1%, p=0.955) were similar between the two groups. While Black Veterans were less likely to experience major post-operative complications, there was no difference in 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, or disease-free survival between the two groups. Black patients had significantly better risk-adjusted overall survival (HR=0.802, 95% CI=0.729-0.883, p<0.001).','Among Veterans with NSCLC undergoing surgical treatment through the VHA, Black patients received comparable care with equivalent if not superior outcomes compared to White patients."
"Trajectory studies have consistently shown that alcohol and cannabis (AC) use during emerging adulthood (EA) affect functioning; however, few studies examine whether racial/ethnic disparities may occur at similar levels of use.','We conducted web-based surveys across five waves from mean age 18.3 through 22.6. The sample (N = 2945) is 55% female, 46% Hispanic, 23% Asian, 23% White, 6% multi-racial (MR)/other, and 2% Black.','Past month substance use was defined as number of days used. Outcomes at age 22.6 included negative consequences, delinquency, physical ailments and health, depression and anxiety, peer relationship functioning, life satisfaction, employment, and education.','Compared to White EAs, Hispanic, Asian, and MR/other EAs reported less initial alcohol use; Hispanic and Asian EAs reported less initial cannabis use, whereas Black EAs reported more cannabis use. Greater initial frequency and increased frequency of AC use were associated with poorer outcomes (e.g., worse mental health). In terms of disparities, compared to White EAs, Hispanic EAs reported poorer physical health at the same levels of AC use; Hispanic, Asian, and MR/other EAs reported greater alcohol consequences and delinquency; Black, Hispanic, Asian and MR/other EAs reported lower life satisfaction; and Hispanic and MR/other EAs were less likely to pursue education beyond high school (although Asian EAs were more likely).','Findings emphasize that trajectories of AC use during EA are associated with a range of functional outcomes. Disparities in functioning at similar levels of AC use highlight the importance of reaching racially/ethnically diverse EAs with prevention and intervention programming."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted socioeconomic and racial health disparities in the USA. In this study, we examined the COVID-19 pandemic as a threat multiplier for childhood health disparities by evaluating health behavior changes among urban St. Louis, MO, children (ages 6-14) during the COVID-19 pandemic. From 27 October to 10 December 2020, 122 parents/guardians reported on their children's health behaviors (Eating, Sleeping, Physical activity, Time outside, Time with friends in-person, Time with friends remotely, Time using media for educational proposes, Time using media for non-educational proposes, and Social connectedness) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We ran K-means cluster analyses to identify distinct health behavior cluster profiles. Relative risks were determined to evaluate behavioral differences between the two clusters. Two distinct cluster profiles were identified: a High Impact profile (n = 49) and a Moderate Impact profile (n = 73). Children in the High Impact cluster had a greater risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19, developed worsened eating habits (RR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.50-2.93), spent less time sleeping, and spent less time outdoors (RR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.03-2.43) than the Moderate Impact cluster. The High Impact cluster was more likely to include Black children and children from single-adult households than the Moderate Impact cluster (both p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may be a threat multiplier for childhood health disparities. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's health."
"Spinal cord stimulation is a promising therapy for patients with treatment refractory pain syndromes, and a viable alternative to chronic opioid therapy. Racial disparities are well-documented in the field of pain medicine. This study seeks to determine whether racial disparities are present in spinal cord stimulator (SCS) surgery involving inpatient hospital stays in the United States.','The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of race on health care cost and utilization for patients receiving inpatient SCS surgery. We used total charges incurred by the patient to measure cost and length of stay (LOS) to measures hospital utilization for patients undergoing inpatient SCS surgery. We examined cost and utilization for inpatient surgeries involving SCS insertion, removal, and revision across different race demographics.','This retrospective cohort study used ICD-10 procedure codes to query for all patients in the 2016-2018 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) who received SCS insertion, removal, and revision surgeries. Univariate analysis was performed in R-studio to assess the relationship between race, LOS, and total charge. Multivariate analysis was also performed in R-studio to adjust for possible confounders.','Hispanic race was associated with higher total charge for inpatient SCS surgery (β=+0.29, p = 3.92e-07). Hospital region was also associated with total charge. The South (β=+0.12, p = 3.7e-03) and the West (β=+0.28, p = 3.8e-09) were associated with higher total charge. The linear model also showed that patients with more comorbidities and complex cases paid higher total charges (β=+0.014, p = 6.2e-04). There was no statistically significant difference in LOS between race demographics.','After adjusting for age, gender, type of surgical approach (percutaneous vs. open), household income, insurance coverage, hospital region, and hospital location (urban vs. rural vs. teaching), and comorbidity scores, Hispanic patients had higher total charges for inpatient SCS surgery, but there was no disparity in total charge between white and black patients. White patients were older than minority patients at the time of inpatient SCS surgery."
"Growth of some pituitary tumors is driven by hormones which vary in concentration along the lines of patient socioeconomic status. Thus, pituitary tumors may exhibit disparities in incidence upon stratification by socioeconomic variables. Exploring for these disparities could provide direction in tumor etiology elucidation and identification of healthcare inequalities.','To investigate pituitary adenoma and carcinoma incidence (per 100,000) with respect to sex, age, income, residence, and race/ethnicity, we searched the largest American administrative dataset (1997-2016), the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS), which surveys 20% of United States (US) discharges.','Annual national incidence was 2.80 for adenomas and 0.046 for carcinomas. For adenomas, males had an incidence of 2.63, similar (p = 0.17) to females at 2.78; likewise, for carcinomas, males had a statistically equivalent (p = 0.24) incidence at 0.051 to females at 0.041. Amongst age groups, for adenomas incidence progressively rose, peaking 65-84 years old (6.12), before declining. For adenomas and carcinomas respectively, patients with low income had an incidence of 2.66 and 0.044, similar (p = 0.11; p = 0.72) to the 3.01 and 0.041 of middle/high income patients. Incidence was greatest for adenomas amongst urban centers (3.47), followed by rural (3.16) and suburban (3.01) communities. Examining race/ethnicity (p = 0.0000016), for adenomas, incidences amongst Blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and Whites were as follows, respectively: 3.64, 2.57, 2.54, 2.44. Annually, incidence for adenomas was increasing (τ = 0.63, p = 0.00021), but decreasing (τ = -0.60, p = 0.00085) for carcinomas. Specifically, for carcinomas incidence was only decreasing for females and the middle/high income.','In the US, time-enduring healthcare disparities were identified for pituitary adenomas and carcinomas, against the background of sociodemographic strata. For carcinomas, annual incidence was declining only for middle/high income patients and females, which supporting prior investigations that low income patients and males are experiencing barriers to definitive treatment for pituitary adenomas. Incidence was also found to be greatest Blacks and urban residents."
"The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act led to the rapid implementation of telemedicine across healthcare office settings. This innovation has the potential to improve healthcare use and ensure continuity of care. However, this delivery model could have an unintended consequence of worsening racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare utilization if adoption varies across sub-populations.','To examine associations between telemedicine use and race/ethnicity between 3/1/2020 and 11/30/2020, and the influence of other individual- and geographical-level factors on this relationship.','Cohort study PARTICIPANTS: EMR data from 55 clinics in a FQHC network MAIN MEASURES: The dependent variable was visit type (in-person vs. telemedicine). Predictors of interest were patient race and ethnicity. To account for repeated visits within each patient nested within clinic, a three-level, mixed-effects, multivariable, logistic regression model was used. Subgroup analyses examined correlates of telemedicine use in African American and Hispanic cohorts, separately.','The analytic sample included 233,302 visits for 67,733 unique patients. African Americans (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.69), Asians (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.65), and American Indians / Alaska Natives and other Pacific Islanders (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70, 0.98) were significantly less likely to use telemedicine compared to Whites. Hispanics were also less likely to have a telemedicine visit (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.51) compared to non-Hispanics. Nonacute visits were more likely to be conducted via telemedicine. Distance to clinic exhibited a dose-response relationship such that patients who lived farthest from the clinics were most likely to have telemedicine visits. In the subgroup analyses to examine predictors of telemedicine use, the dose-response relationship between distance from clinic and telemedicine use persisted, with increasing distance associated with increasing likelihood of telemedicine use, in both African American and Hispanic cohorts. Nonacute visits were associated with telemedicine use in the Hispanic cohort, but not in the Black / African American cohort.','Racial/ethnic disparities in telemedicine use persisted among this cohort. However, telemedicine improved utilization for African Americans and Hispanics living farther away from the clinic."
"Despite the unequal burden of environmental exposures borne by racially minoritized communities, these groups are often underrepresented in public health research. Here, we examined racial/ethnic disparities in exposure to metals among a multi-ethnic sample of pregnant women. The sample included women enrolled in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) pregnancy cohort (N = 382). Urinary metal concentrations (arsenic [As], barium [Ba], cadmium [Cd], cesium [Cs], chromium [Cr], lead [Pb], antimony [Sb]) were measured during mid-pregnancy and information on individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics was ascertained during an in-person interview and from publicly available databases, respectively. Linear regression was used to examine individual and neighborhood characteristics in relation to metal concentrations. Black/Black-Hispanic women had Cd, Cr, Pb, and Sb levels that were 142.0%, 10.9%, 35.0%, and 32.1% higher than White, non-Hispanic women, respectively. Likewise, White-Hispanic women had corresponding levels that were 141.5%, 108.2%, 59.9%, and 38.3% higher. These same metals were also higher among women residing in areas with higher crime, higher diversity, lower educational attainment, lower household income, and higher poverty. Significant disparities in exposure to metals exist and may be driven by neighborhood-level factors. Exposure to metals for pregnant women can be especially harmful. Understanding exposure inequalities and identifying factors that increase risk can help inform targeted public health interventions."
"South Africa has long endured a high prevalence of mental disorders at the national level, and its unique social and historical context could be a contributor to an increased risk of mental health problems. Our current understanding is limited regarding the relative importance of various social determinants to mental health challenges in South Africa, and how existing racial inequities may be explained by these determinants.','This study attempted to elucidate potential social determinants of mental health in South Africa using data from the nationally representative South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1). The main outcome of interest was psychological distress, measured with the Kessler-10 scale. Hierarchical linear regression models included covariates for demographic and socioeconomic factors, count of traumatic events, and a series of stress-related constructs. Analyses were conducted on two populations: the entire sample (n = 15,981), and the African subpopulation (n = 10,723).','Regression models on the entire sample indicated racial disparities in psychological distress, with Africans experiencing higher distress than White and Coloured individuals. Results within the African sub-population indicated geo-spatial disparities, with Africans in formal urban settings experiencing higher psychological distress than those living in formal and informal rural locales. Across both samples, results indicated a cumulative association between count of stressors and traumatic events and distress.','We found racial disparities across several mental health-related domains. Africans had greater exposure to traumatic events, social stressors, and psychological distress. This research is a necessary foundation for public health interventions and policy change to effectively reduce inequities in psychological distress."
"A reduction in racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality requires effective education of both patients and providers. Although providers seem to recognize that disparities exist, there is a widespread need for improving our understanding differences in health care and outcomes and the factors that contribute to them. There are increasingly more educational materials available for the purpose of augmenting disparities education among patients and providers. However, it is important to incorporate contemporary learning methodologies and technologies to address our current knowledge deficit. Collaborative educational models with a multi-disciplinary approach to patient education will be essential. Ultimately, the comprehensive education of providers and patients will require efforts on the part of numerous stakeholders within patient care delivery models. Further investigation will be necessary to determine how best to disseminate this information to maximize the impact of patient and provider educations with the goal of eliminating disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality."
"To evaluate trends in racial and ethnic disparities in weekly cumulative rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths in Connecticut nursing homes.','Longitudinal analysis of nursing-home COVID-19 reports and other databases. Multivariable negative binomial models were used to estimate disparities in COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates across nursing-home groups with varying proportions of racial and ethnic minority residents, defined as low-, medium-, medium-high-, and high-proportion groups. Trends in such disparities were estimated from week 1 (April 13) to week 10 (ending on June 19, 2020).','The study was conducted across 211 nursing homes.','The average number of cases ranged from 6.1 cases per facility for the low-proportion group to 11.7 cases per facility for the high-proportion group in week 1, and from 26.7 to 58.5 cases per facility in week 10. Compared to the low-proportion group, the adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the high-proportion group were 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.80; P > .10) in week 1 and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05-2.25; P < .05) in week 10, showing a 30% (95% CI, 5%-62%) relative increase (P < .05). The average weekly number of COVID-19-related deaths ranged from 0 to 0.3 deaths per facility for different groups in week 1, and from 7.6 to 13.3 deaths per facility in week 10. Adjusted disparities in fatalities similarly increased over time.','Connecticut nursing homes caring for predominately racial and ethnic minority residents tended to have higher COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates. These across-facility disparities increased during the early periods of the pandemic."
"Racial disparities in diagnosis, treatment and survival in Black patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to White patients have not been well studied, largely due to limited number of studies and information on Black patients in healthcare systems. Studying racial disparities and identifying underlying factors in large populations are important to understand PD and improve care.','We retrospectively identified PD patients on both races from 1/1/2006 to 10/31/2017 and compared demographics, socioeconomic status (educations, incomes and insurances), comorbidities (all categories, including mood, cognition and psychosis), treatment (medications for parkinsonism and major non-motor symptoms, and frequency and locations of healthcare) and survival, and identified factors associated with medication usage and survival.','We retrospectively studied 2033 PD patients, of whom 725 were Black. Black patients lacked male predominance, were 4 years older at first diagnosis here, more likely to smoke and live in a low education and income community, and possessed limited insurances compared to White patients. Black patients also had more comorbidities and were more likely to receive care through emergency or inpatient service, but less likely to be on medications for parkinsonism and mood disorders. Race, age, smoking status, insurance type, frequency and locations of healthcare and comorbidities were associated with medication usage. Black race, older age, inpatient admission and malignancy were associated with increased risk of death.','We revealed racial disparities in diagnosis, treatment and survival, and factors associated with medication usage and survival in the largest reported Black PD cohort from a single center."
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has exacerbated the longstanding racial/ethnic health disparities in the USA, with a disproportionately negative effect on children of color. This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children.','Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences.','This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics."
"To investigate sexual orientation-related disparities in employment and healthcare, including potential contributions to health-related quality of life (HRQL).','Growing Up Today Study, a USA-based longitudinal cohort that began in 1996; predominantly composed of participants who are white and of middle-to-high socioeconomic positions.','9914 participants 18-32 years old at the most recent follow-up questionnaire.','In 2013, participants reported if, in the last year, they had been unemployed, uninsured or lacked healthcare access (routine physical exam). Participants completed the EQ-5D-5L, a validated, preference-weighted measurement of HRQL. After adjusting for potential confounders, we used sex-stratified, log-binomial models to calculate the association of sexual orientation with employment, health insurance and healthcare access, while examining if these variables attenuated the sexual orientation-related HRQL disparities.','Sexual minority women and men were about twice as likely as their respective heterosexual counterparts to have been unemployed and uninsured. For example, the risk ratio (95% CI) of uninsured bisexual women was 3.76 (2.42 to 5.85) and of unemployed mostly heterosexual men was 1.82 (1.30 to 2.54). Routine physical examination was not different across sexual orientation groups (p>0.05). All sexual minority subgroups had worse HRQL than heterosexuals (p<0.05) across the five EQ-5D-5L dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Controlling for employment and health insurance did not substantially attenuate the existing sexual orientation-related HRQL disparities.','Research on sexual orientation-related disparities in employment and healthcare has often been limited to comparisons between cohabitating different-sex and same-sex adult couples, overlooking sexual minority subgroups (eg, bisexuals vs lesbians), non-cohabitating populations and young people. Less is known about sexual orientation-related disparities in HRQL including potential contributions from employment and healthcare. The current study documents that disparities in employment, health insurance and various HRQL dimensions are pervasive across sexual minority subgroups, non-cohabitating couples and youth in families of middle-to-high socioeconomic positions."
"Racial and ethnic disparities are prevalent within healthcare and have persisted despite advances in medicine and public health. Disparities have been described in the use of neuraxial labor analgesia, with minority women being less likely to use neuraxial labor analgesia than non-minority white women. Minority women are also more likely to have a general anesthetic for cesarean delivery than non-minority women. The origins of these disparities are likely multi-factorial, with patient-, provider-, and systems-level contributors. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of disparities in obstetric anesthesia."
"Despite extraordinary strides in cancer therapy over the past 30 years, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and age-related survival disparities persist. Hodgkin lymphoma offers an excellent paradigm to understand these disparities because successful approaches are well established in both the up-front and relapsed treatment settings. The following review, which accompanies the 2021 NCCN Guidelines for Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma, suggests that systemic inequities in cancer care disproportionately affect minority and low-income children, adolescents, and young adults, and directly contribute to observed disparities in cancer-related outcomes. It proposes that the first step toward reducing disparities is large-scale dissemination of guidelines, because equity is best achieved when treatment approaches are clear, comprehensive, and standardized across all clinical practice settings."
"Globally, intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of gender-based violence, and wife beating is one component of intimate partner violence, with the problem being more severe among women living in rural settings. Little is known about the factors that explain the urban-rural disparity in the prevalence of wife beating attitude in Senegal. In this paper, we aimed to decompose the urban-rural disparities in factors associated with wife beating attitude among married women in Senegal.','Data were derived from the 2017 Senegal Continuous Demographic and Health Survey. We used the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to decompose and explain the variation in the prevalence of disagreement to wife beating between urban and rural areas in Senegal.','The results show that 48.9% of married women in Senegal disagreed with wife-beating. About 69% of urban women disagreed with wife beating, but only 36% of rural women disagreed with wife beating. About 68.7% of women in the sample reported that they disagreed to wife beating by their husbands for burning food and nearly 50% of women reported that they disagreed with wife beating when they refuse to have sex with their husbands. About 86% of the urban-rural disparities in disagreement with wife beating are explained in this study. Economic status (45.2%), subnational region (22.4%), women's educational status (13.3%), and husband's educational status (10.7%) accounted for 91.6% of the disparities.','The study shows urban-rural disparities in the prevalence of wife-beating attitude (disagreement with wife beating) and this disfavored rural residents. We suggest the need for the government of Senegal to consider pro-rural equity strategies to narrow down the observed disparities. Moreover, socioeconomic empowerment and attitudinal changing interventions using existing socio-cultural institutions as platforms can be used to deliver such interventions."
"The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and associated disparities among Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native children and teenagers has been documented. Reducing these disparities along with overcoming unintended negative consequences of the pandemic, such as the disruption of in-person schooling, calls for broad community-based collaborations and nuanced approaches. Based on national survey data, children from some racial and ethnic minority groups have a higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension; were diagnosed more frequently with COVID-19; and had more severe outcomes compared with their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Furthermore, a higher proportion of children from some racial and ethnic minority groups lived in families with incomes less than 200% of the federal poverty level or in households lacking secure employment compared with NHW children. Children from some racial and ethnic minority groups were also more likely to attend school via online learning compared with NHW counterparts. Because the root causes of these disparities are complex and multifactorial, an organized community-based approach is needed to achieve greater proactive and sustained collaborations between local health departments, local school systems, and other public and private organizations to pursue health equity. This article provides a summary of potential community-based health promotion strategies to address racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes and educational inequities among children and teens, specifically in the implementation of strategic partnerships, including initial collective work, outcomes-based activities, and communication. These collaborations can facilitate policy, systems, and environmental changes in school systems that support emergency preparedness, recovery, and resilience when faced with public health crises."
"The use of telemedicine has grown immensely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine provides a means to deliver clinical care while limiting patient and provider exposure to the COVID-19. As such, telemedicine is finding applications in a variety of clinical environments including primary care and the acute care setting and the array of patient populations who use telemedicine continues to grow. Yet as telehealth becomes ubiquitous, it is critical to consider its potential to exacerbate disparities in care. Challenges accessing technology and digital literacy, for example, disproportionately impact older patients and those living in poverty. When implemented with the consideration of health disparities, telemedicine provides an opportunity to address these inequities. This manuscript explores potential mechanisms by which telemedicine may play a role in exacerbating or ameliorating disparities in care. We further describe a framework and suggested strategies with which to implement telemedicine systems to improve health equity."
"To examine the patterns and predictors of dental utilisation in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and non-CALD groups in New South Wales.','Secondary analysis of the 2013 and 2015 NSW Adult Population Health Survey (n=24,707).','Dental utilisation, defined as a dental visit within the last 12 months. CALD groups were defined using country of birth and language. Andersen's theoretical model was used. Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounding. Sample weights adjusted for sampling design.','Most (69%) of the population were Australian born; 20% spoke a language other than English at home. Dental utilisation was 58.9% and 63.9% for CALD and non-CALD groups respectively. The foreign-born non-English speaking group had the highest level of education (60%) but lower levels of dental utilisation (OR:0.81, CI 0.69-0.94) than all groups. Australian born non-English speakers had similar levels of dental utilisation to the reference group (OR:1.27, CI 0.99-1.63).','There are significant disparities in dental care utilisation among CALD populations. Foreign born, non-English speaking CALD migrants, and people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, are at greatest risk of inadequate dental utilisation. Furthermore, the combination of predisposing factors, language and cultural barriers compound disparities in oral health care utilisation. This data highlights the need for oral healthcare services that are sensitive to population needs, to reduce disparities among CALD communities residing in NSW."
"There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in receipt of reperfusion interventions for acute ischemic stroke. Our objective was to determine whether there are disparities in access to stroke center care by race or ethnicity that help explain differences in reperfusion therapy and to understand whether interhospital patient transfer plays a role in improving access.','Using statewide administrating data including all emergency department and hospital discharges in California from 2010 to 2017, we identified all acute ischemic stroke patients. Primary outcomes of interest included presentation to primary or comprehensive stroke center (PSC or CSC), interhospital transfer, discharge from PSC or CSC, and discharge from CSC alone. We used hierarchical logistic regression modeling to identify the relationship between patient- and hospital-level characteristics and outcomes of interest.','Of 336,247 ischemic stroke patients, 55.4% were non-Hispanic White, 19.6% Hispanic, 10.6% non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander, and 10.3% non-Hispanic Black. There was no difference in initial presentation to stroke center hospitals between groups. However, adjusted odds of reperfusion intervention, interhospital transfer and discharge from CSC did vary by race and ethnicity. Adjusted odds of interhospital transfer were lower among Hispanic (odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 0.98) and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander patients (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.90) and odds of discharge from a CSC were lower for Hispanic (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97) and non-Hispanic Black patients (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.81).','There are racial and ethnic disparities in reperfusion intervention receipt among stroke patients in California. Stroke system of care design, hospital resources, and transfer patterns may contribute to this disparity."

"Pregnant women with COVID-19 are at increased risk for adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes, and birth complications. Given the health outcome disparities among pregnant women of racial and ethnic minorities and the reliance of medical practice on systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs)-as they are the apical component in the hierarchy of evidence in medical research-the primary objective of the study is to examine the inclusion of the equity reporting in SRMAs focused on pregnancy outcomes and COVID-19 using PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. PROGRESS represents equity measures of Place, Race, Occupation, Gender, Religion, Education, Social capital, and Socio-economic status.','We conducted a systematic search of three databases to identify SRMAs related to maternal and pregnancy outcomes related to COVID-19. We extracted whether SRMAs reported or analyzed PROGRESS-Plus components among other study characteristics.','Nearly 85% of SRMAs did not include any equity items to account for racial or geographic disparities. Reporting of race was absent from 95% of the studies. Place was the most common PROGRESS item and maternal age was the most common PROGRESS-<i>Plus</i> item reported overall.','When research is performed and reported in a way that fails to address disparities, the downstream repercussions may include medical care in the form of new protocol-driven hospital management, pharmacologic interventions, and other treatment options that mirror this absence in reporting. The absence of adequate reporting widens gaps in health outcomes among at-risk groups, such as pregnant women of racial and ethnic minorities."
"The extent to which healthcare worker (HCWs) experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic vary by race or ethnicity after adjustment for confounding factors is not currently known.','We performed an observational prospective cohort study of 24,769 healthcare workers from 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, enrolled between April 10, 2020 and June 30, 2021, and evaluated participant experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including testing, diagnosis with COVID-19, emotional experiences, burnout, and interest in vaccines and vaccine clinical trials.','After adjustment for professional role, medical history, and community characteristics, Black and Asian participants were less likely to receive SARS-CoV-2 viral testing (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0·82 [0·70, 0·96], p=0·012 and aOR 0·77 [0·67, 0·89], p<0·001 respectively) than White participants.

"Health advances have not benefited all people equally. Health equity remains an aspirational goal, but research that enhances health equity is the highest priority at the National Institutes of Health. Here, we propose a call to action and outline current National Institutes of Health programs that aim to eliminate health disparities both broadly and in high priority areas. Discussed topics include stroke as an indicator of broad health inequity, challenges, and opportunities in health disparities research, the need to diversify the research workforce, and the ongoing efforts and struggles to establish trust with disadvantaged communities during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Data on the health burden of COVID-19 among Asian American people of various ethnic subgroups remain limited. We examined COVID-19 outcomes of people of various Asian ethnic subgroups and other racial and ethnic groups in an urban safety net hospital system.','We conducted a retrospective analysis of 85 328 adults aged ≥18 tested for COVID-19 at New York City's public hospital system from March 1 through May 31, 2020. We examined COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidities known to worsen COVID-19 outcomes. We conducted adjusted multivariable regression analyses examining racial and ethnic disparities in mortality.','Of 9971 Asian patients (11.7% of patients overall), 48.2% were South Asian, 22.2% were Chinese, and 29.6% were in other Asian ethnic groups. South Asian patients had the highest rates of COVID-19 positivity (30.8%) and hospitalization (51.6%) among Asian patients, second overall only to Hispanic (32.1% and 45.8%, respectively) and non-Hispanic Black (27.5% and 57.5%, respectively) patients. Chinese patients had a mortality rate of 35.7%, highest of all racial and ethnic groups. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities, only Chinese patients had significantly higher odds of mortality than non-Hispanic White patients (odds ratio = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04-2.01).','Asian American people, particularly those of South Asian and Chinese descent, bear a substantial and disproportionate health burden of COVID-19.

"While sex-related differences in transplant outcomes have been well characterized amongst adults, there are no sex-specific pediatric heart transplant studies over the last decade and none evaluating waitlist outcomes. In a contemporary cohort of children undergoing heart transplantation in the United States, this analysis was performed to determine if there were sex disparities in waitlist and/or post-transplant outcomes.','Retrospective review of Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database from December 16, 2011 to February 28, 2019 to compare male and female children after listing and after transplant. Demographic, clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared unadjusted and after 1:1 propensity matching for selected covariates.','Of 4089 patients, 2299 (56%) were males. At listing, males were more likely to be older, have congenital heart disease (58% vs 48%), renal dysfunction (49% vs 44%) and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (9% vs 7%). At transplant, males were more likely to have renal (42 % vs 35%) and liver dysfunction (13% vs 10%), PRA >10% (29% vs 22%) and ischemic time >3.5 hours (p < 0.05 for all). There were no significant sex differences found in unadjusted rates of transplant or mortality. After propensity matching, females had increased waitlist mortality (HR 1.3, 95%CI 1.04-1.5; p =0.019) compared to males. There were no significant differences in post-transplant morbidity or mortality (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.93-1.5; p = 0.18) between groups.','In a contemporary pediatric cohort, females have inferior heart transplant waitlist survival compared to propensity-matched males despite lower acuity of illness at listing and similar rates of transplantation. There were no sex-disparities noted in post-transplant outcomes."
"It is well established that racial health disparities are impacted by structural racism, but the imbrication of racialization processes with processes of disablement remains underdeveloped. This essay advocates for a conceptual lens that looks historically and politically at the co-constitution of ""race"" and ""disability."" Racism and ableism intersect in ways that manifest what I call racialized disablement, a key heuristic for building a fuller understanding of ""race"" and ""racial health disparities."" This terminology, I propose, helps illuminate the following about race and racism in healthcare: first, racialized disablement seeks to denaturalize both race and disability to focus on their political production. Using process-based terms related to both race and disability heightens the sense in which neither inhere in particular, individual bodies, but rather persist in contexts of ongoing structural oppressions, materializing populations subject to racialization and disablement. Secondly, and relatedly, racialized disablement aims to identify racism and ableism as co-constitutive-historically, politically, and conceptually intertwined. Without an awareness of the fluidity of race- and disability-based markers and the systems of power generating their materialization, our understandings of racial disparities in health and healthcare are incomplete."
"Although high volume centers (HVC) equate to improved outcomes in rectal cancer, the impact of surgical volume related to race is less defined.','Patients who underwent surgical resection for stage I-III rectal adenocarcinoma were divided into cohorts based on race and hospital surgical volume. Outcomes were analyzed following 1:1 propensity-score matching using logistic, Poisson, and Cox regression analyses with marginal effects.','Fifty-four thousand one hundred and eighty-four (91.5%) non-Black and 5043 (8.5%) Black patients underwent resection of rectal cancer. Following 1:1 matching of non-Black (N = 5026) and Black patients, 5-year overall survival (OS) of Black patients was worse (72% vs. 74.4%, average marginal effects [AME] 0.66, p = 0.04) than non-Black patients. When compared to non-Black patients managed at HVCs, Black patients had worse OS (70.1% vs. 74.7%, AME 1.55, p = 0.03), but this difference was not significant when comparing OS between non-Black and Black patients managed at HVCs (72.3% vs. 74.7%, AME 0.62, p = 0.06). Length of stay was longer among Black and HVC patients across all cohorts. There was no difference across cohorts in 90-day mortality.','Although racial disparities exist in rectal cancer, this disparity appears to be ameliorated when patients are managed at HVCs."
"Faith and public health partnerships offer promise to addressing health disparities, but examples that incorporate African-Americans and Latino congregations are lacking. Here we present results from developing a multi-ethnic, multi-denominational faith and public health partnership to address health disparities through community-based participatory research (CBPR), focusing on several key issues: (1) the multi-layered governance structure and activities to establish the partnership and identify initial health priority (obesity), (2) characteristics of the congregations recruited to partnership (n = 66), and (3) the lessons learned from participating congregations' past work on obesity that informed the development of a multi-level, multi-component, church-based intervention. Having diverse staff with deep ties in the faith community, both among researchers and the primary community partner agency, was key to recruiting African-American and Latino churches. Involvement by local health department and community health clinic personnel provided technical expertise and support regarding health data and clinical resources. Selecting a health issue-obesity-that affected all subgroups (e.g., African-Americans and Latinos, women and men, children and adults) garnered high enthusiasm among partners, as did including some innovative aspects such as a text/e-mail messaging component and a community mapping exercise to identify issues for advocacy. Funding that allowed for an extensive community engagement and planning process was key to successfully implementing a CBPR approach. Building partnerships through which multiple CBPR initiatives can be done offers efficiencies and sustainability in terms of programmatic activities, though long-term infrastructure grants, institutional support, and non-research funding from local foundations and health systems are likely needed."
"Engaging socioeconomically disadvantaged populations in health research is vital to understanding and, ultimately, eliminating health-related disparities. Digital communication channels are increasingly used to recruit study participants, and recent trends indicate a growing need to partner with the social service sector to improve population health. However, few studies have recruited participants from social service settings using multiple digital channels.','This study aimed to recruit and survey 3791 adult clients of a social service organization via telephone and digital channels. This paper aimed to describe recruitment outcomes across five channels and compare participant characteristics by recruitment channel type.','The Cancer Communication Channels in Context Study recruited and surveyed adult clients of 2-1-1, a social service-focused information and referral system, using five channels: telephone, website, text message, web-based live chat, and email. Participants completed surveys administered either by phone (if recruited by phone) or on the web (if recruited from digital channels, ie, website, text message, Web-based live chat, or email). Measures for the current analysis included demographic and health characteristics.','A total of 3293 participants were recruited, with 1907 recruited by phone and 1386 recruited from digital channels. Those recruited by phone had a moderate study eligibility rate (42.23%) and the highest survey completion rate (91.24%) of all channels. Individuals recruited by text message had a high study eligibility rate (94.14%) yet the lowest survey completion rate (74.0%) of all channels. Sample accrual goals were achieved for phone, text message, and website recruitment. Multivariable analyses found differences in participant characteristics by recruitment channel type. Compared with participants recruited by phone, those recruited from digital channels were younger (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.96, 95% CI 0.96-0.97) and more likely to be female (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.23-1.88), married (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22-1.89), and other than non-Hispanic black (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.22-1.79). Those recruited via phone also were more likely to have more than a high school education (aOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.67-2.82), have a household income ≥US $25,000 a year (aOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.56-2.61), and have children living in the home (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.51). Additionally, participants recruited from digital channels were less likely than those recruited by phone to have public health insurance (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90) and more likely to report better overall health (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.27-1.83 for good-to-excellent health).','Findings indicate the feasibility and utility of recruiting socioeconomically disadvantaged adults from the social service sector using multiple communication channels, including digital channels. As social service-based health research evolves, strategic recruitment using a combination of traditional and digital channels may be warranted to avoid underrepresentation of highly medically vulnerable individuals, which could exacerbate disparities in health."
"To investigate racial disparities in uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) and ovarian carcinosarcoma (OCS) in Commission on Cancer®-accredited facilities.','Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) women in the National Cancer Database diagnosed with stage I-IV UCS or OCS between 2004 and 2014 were eligible. Differences by disease site or race were compared using Chi-square test and multivariate Cox analysis.','There were 2830 NHBs and 7366 NHWs with UCS, and 280 NHBs and 2586 NHWs with OCS. Diagnosis of UCS was more common in NHBs (11.5%) vs. NHWs (3.7%) and increased with age (P < .0001). OCS diagnosis remained <5% in both races and all ages. NHBs with UCS or OCS were more common in the South and more likely to have a comorbidity score ≥ 1, low neighborhood income and Medicaid or no insurance (P < .0001). Diagnosis at stage II-IV was more common in NHBs than NHWs with UCS but not OCS. NHBs with both UCS and OCS were less likely to undergo surgery and to achieve no gross residual disease with surgery (P = .002). Risk of death in NHB vs. NHW patients with UCS was 1.38 after adjustment for demographic factors and dropped after sequential adjustment for comorbidity score, neighborhood income, insurance status, stage and treatment by 4%, 16%, 7%, 19% and 10%, respectively, leaving 43.5% of the racial disparity in survival unexplained. In contrast, risk of death in NHBs vs. NHWs with OCS was 1.19 after adjustment for demographic factors and became insignificant after adjustment for comorbidity. Race was an independent prognostic factor in UCS but not in OCS.','Racial disparities exist in characteristics, treatment and survival in UCS and OCS with distinctions that merit additional research."
"Disparities in bladder cancer survival by race/ethnicity and gender are likely related to differences in diagnosis. We assessed disparities in stage at diagnosis and potential contributing factors within a large, integrated delivery system.','We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 7244 patients with bladder cancer age ≥ 21 years diagnosed from January 2001 to June 2015 within Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Bivariate analyses compared stage at diagnosis - as well as comorbidities, health plan membership length, and health care utilization prior to diagnosis - by race/ethnicity, gender, and age. Multivariable generalized linear mixed models with urologist as a random effect were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diagnosis of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) versus non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.','In multivariable analyses, stage at diagnosis varied significantly by race/ethnicity (P < .001). Non-Hispanic black patients had significantly higher odds of being diagnosed with MIBC than non-Hispanic white patients (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.67), whereas Asian patients had significantly lower odds (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49-0.91). Women were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with MIBC than men (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.22-1.61). Non-Hispanic black women had the highest proportion (39%) of MIBC diagnoses. Among Hispanic and Asian patients, a greater proportion of diagnoses occurred at younger ages.','Health care coverage within an equal-access system did not eliminate disparities in stage at diagnosis by race/ethnicity or gender. Studies are needed to identify etiologic factors and aspects of care delivery (eg, patient-physician interactions) that may affect the diagnostic process to inform efforts to improve health equity."
"Objectives High infant mortality rates among American Indians in North Dakota contribute to a 20-year gap in average age at death compared to whites. Geographic- and race-specific health disparities data to drive policy making and interventions are not well disseminated. The current study examines prenatal risk factors and birth outcomes between American Indian and whites in North Dakota. Methods A retrospective descriptive analysis of North Dakota live births from 2007 to 2012 was conducted. Period prevalence and prevalence ratios were calculated. Results The infant mortality rate from 2010 to 2012 for infants born to American Indian women was 3.5 times higher than whites. Racial disparities existed in education, teen births, tobacco use during pregnancy, and breastfeeding initiation. Disparities widened for inadequate prenatal care, illegal drug use during pregnancy, and infant mortality from 2007-2009 to 2010-2012 and narrowed for sexually transmitted infections and alcohol use during pregnancy. Conclusions for Practice American Indians are disproportionately affected by poor pregnancy and birth outcomes in North Dakota. Future geographic-specific American Indian research is warranted to aid current and future public health interventions."
"Relatively little is known about experiences of barriers in access to overall care for people with mental health conditions (MHCs), or disparities between people with and without MHCs, or how patterns vary across countries.','The 2016 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of adults was used to compare access barriers for people with MHCs across 11 countries, and disparities within countries between people with and without an MHC, using normalized scores. Disparities were also assessed by using multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, immigrant status, income, and self-rated health.','On average, people with MHCs had a higher prevalence of barriers, with a gap of 7 percentage points between people with and without MHCs. The gap ranged from 5 to 9% across countries. For people with an MHC, the most common access barriers were skipping care due to cost (26%) and receiving conflicting information from providers (26%). For all countries, having an MHC was associated with higher odds of experiencing barriers of access to care on several measures, with at least 1 case where the adjusted odds were greater than 2.','There is an imperative to improve monitoring of access to overall health care for people with MHCs and an opportunity learn from countries with fewer barriers and disparities in access to care."
"Early life exposure to phthalates may be associated with reduced cognition. However, it is unknown if disproportionate exposure to phthalates contributes to racial disparities in children's intellectual abilities.','We used data from 253 mother-child pairs in Cincinnati, OH (the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment study, 2003-2006). We measured urinary concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites twice during pregnancy and up to six times in childhood. We evaluated children's cognitive abilities at ages 5 and 8 years. Using mediation models, we quantified covariate-adjusted direct and indirect effects of race on children's Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores for individual phthalate metabolite concentrations during gestation and childhood.','Average IQ scores among Black children (n = 90) were 7.0 points lower (95% confidence interval [CI] = -12, -1.8) than among White children (n = 145) after adjustment for socioeconomic factors. Urinary monobenzyl phthalate and monoethyl phthalate (MEP) concentrations during gestation and childhood were higher among Black than White children. We did not observe evidence that phthalate concentrations mediated the race-IQ association, with the exception of MEP. Childhood MEP concentrations partially mediated the race-IQ association. For instance, each 10-fold increase in MEP concentrations at age 2 years contributed to a 1.9-point disparity in IQ scores between Black and White children (95% CI = -4.7, 0.7). Other phthalate metabolite concentrations during pregnancy or childhood did not mediate the race-IQ association.','Despite observing racial disparities in exposure to some phthalates and IQ, we found little evidence that phthalates contribute to IQ disparities."
"Previous work has shown that asthma-related emergency department (ED) use is greatest among Black and Latine populations, but it is unknown whether health care use for exacerbations differs across settings (outpatient, ED, inpatient) and correlates with use of routine outpatient services. We aimed to measure disparities by race, ethnicity, and language in pediatric acute asthma care using data from US primary care community health centers.','In an observational study using electronic health records from community health centers in 18 states, we compared non-Hispanic Black, English-preferring Latine, Spanish-preferring Latine, and non-Hispanic White children aged 3 to 17 years on visits for clinic-coded asthma exacerbations (2012-2018). We further evaluated asthma-related ED use and inpatient admissions in a subsample of Oregon-Medicaid recipients. Covariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and rate ratios (RRs) were derived using logistic or negative binomial regression analysis with generalized estimating equations.','Among 41,276 children with asthma, Spanish-preferring Latine children had higher odds of clinic visits for asthma exacerbation than non-Hispanic White peers (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18). Among the subsample of 6,555 children insured under Oregon-Medicaid, non-Hispanic Black children had higher odds and rates of asthma-related ED use than non-Hispanic White peers (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.04-1.89 and RR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.09-2.04, respectively). We observed no differences between groups in asthma-related inpatient admissions.','This study is the first to show that patterns of clinic and ED acute-care use differ for non-Hispanic Black and Spanish-preferring Latine children when compared with non-Hispanic White peers. Non-Hispanic Black children had lower use of clinics, whereas Spanish-preferring Latine children had higher use, including for acute exacerbations. These patterns of clinic use were accompanied by higher ED use among Black children. Ensuring adequate care in clinics may be important in mitigating disparities in asthma outcomes.<b>VISUAL ABSTRACT</b>."
"In the United States, Black individuals have higher stroke incidence and mortality when compared to white individuals and are also at risk of having lower stroke knowledge and awareness. With the need to implement focused interventions to decrease stroke disparities, the objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an emergency department-based educational intervention aimed at increasing stroke awareness and preparedness among a disproportionately high-risk group.','Over a three-month timeframe, an emergency department-based, prospective educational intervention was implemented for Black patients in an urban, academic emergency department. All participants received stroke education in the forms of a video, written brochure and verbal counseling.  Stroke knowledge was assessed pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at one-month post-intervention.','One hundred eighty-five patients were approached for enrollment, of whom 100 participants completed the educational intervention as well as the pre- and immediate post- intervention knowledge assessments. Participants demonstrated increased stroke knowledge from baseline knowledge assessment (5.35 ± 1.97) at both immediate post-intervention (7.66 ± 2.42, p < .0001) and one-month post-intervention assessment (7.21 ± 2.21, p < .0001).','Emergency department-based stroke education can result in improved knowledge among this focused demographic. The emergency department represents a potential site for educational interventions to address disparities in stroke knowledge."
"Calls continue for staff training as an instrumental response to racially based differences in rates of child protection system interactions and outcomes. These recommendations echo a reliance on implicit bias and diversity training (referred to broadly as ""anti-bias and racial sensitivity training"") across disciplines of social and human services in the United States as a feasible and politically expedient solution to racial disparities. But focusing on anti-bias training to address racial disparities in child protection systems will almost certainly fail to achieve desired objectives for at least three reasons: (a) there is no evidence that implicit bias or racial sensitivity trainings change behavior; (b) personnel training initiatives misapply an individual behavioral solution to an institutional and structural problem; and (c) an emphasis on internal training initiatives distracts and reduces the accountability of other systems of care better positioned to produce change. We conclude that if the goal is to reduce racial disparities, systemic innovations and broader policy reforms both internal and external to the child protection system are needed. Training will not meaningfully shift the downstream effects of structural racism."
"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid implementation of telemedicine at medical centers across the United States. As telemedicine is expected to persist beyond the pandemic in subspecialties like pediatric dermatology, there is growing concern that socioeconomic factors may contribute to inequitable telemedicine access. This study aims to identify factors associated with disparities in telemedicine use among pediatric dermatology patients during the pandemic.','In this single-center cross-sectional study, patients less than 18 years old who completed a visit with a pediatric dermatologist via a video telemedicine call or in-person office visit during the specified time periods were included. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to compare demographic factors for (1) patients who had a telemedicine visit versus office visit during June 1, 2020, to January 22, 2021, and (2) patients who had either visit type during June 1, 2020, to January 22, 2021, versus June 1, 2019, to January 2020.','The independent factors associated with lower odds of telemedicine include identifying as Black/African American, having a non-English preferred language, and having public insurance, whereas the independent factors reducing overall access to pediatric dermatology care during the pandemic include identifying as Hispanic/Latino and having public insurance.','Differential telemedicine use in vulnerable communities may be attributed to disparities in technology access and digital literacy and should be addressed at a structural level. If such disparities are identified and adequately remedied, telemedicine can serve as an important tool for expanding access in the field of pediatric dermatology."
"There are recognized racial-ethnic disparities in preterm birth and in maternal cardiometabolic risk factors likely linked to systemic racism. However, it is unclear the extent to which cardiometabolic risk factors contribute to the higher rates of preterm birth among minoritized populations.','This study aimed to evaluate racial-ethnic disparities in preterm birth subtypes and the role of maternal cardiometabolic risk factors as mediators of the association between maternal race-ethnicity and preterm birth subtypes.','This was a retrospective cohort study of 295,210 singleton live births from 2011 to 2018. Preterm birth subtypes were defined as medically indicated and spontaneous preterm birth. Poisson regression with robust standard errors were used to provide estimates of the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for preterm birth subtypes. Causal mediation analysis used logistic regression models to estimate the natural direct and natural indirect (mediated) effects of maternal cardiometabolic risk factors.','Compared with White individuals, Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals were at increased risk for having both medically indicated preterm birth (1.45, 1.30-1.61; 1.21, 1.12-1.31; and 1.13, 1.05-1.22, respectively) (risk ratios, 95% confidence intervals, respectively) and spontaneous preterm birth (1.20, 1.08-1.34; 1.34, 1.26-1.43; and 1.16, (1.08-1.23), independent of established risk factors. The extent to which cardiometabolic risk factors mediated the associations between race-ethnicity (each group vs White in separate analyses) and preterm birth subtypes varied by race-ethnicity. Hypertensive disorders mediated 30.1% of the association between Black race-ethnicity and medically indicated preterm birth, but it did not mediate the association for other racial-ethnic groups or for spontaneous preterm birth. Any glucose disorder in pregnancy was a mediator of medically indicated preterm birth and spontaneous preterm birth for Asian (65.8% and 13.9%, respectively) and Hispanic (17.3% and 11.9%) race-ethnicity but not for Black race-ethnicity. Overweight or obesity mediated the association between race-ethnicity and medically indicated preterm birth (15.5% among Black individuals and 25.1% among Hispanic individuals) and spontaneous preterm birth (10.7% among Hispanic individuals) but was not a mediator among Asian individuals.','Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals are at increased risk for preterm birth. Maternal cardiometabolic risk factors partially mediate the associations between race-ethnicity and preterm birth subtypes but the extent varies by race-ethnicity. These findings suggest that strategies that improve and diminish differences in cardiometabolic health between race-ethnicity populations may diminish disparities in preterm birth."
